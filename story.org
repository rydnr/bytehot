* The Vision: Code That Evolves While It Runs

Imagine a world where your Java applications don't need to restart to incorporate changes. Where fixing a bug or adding a feature doesn't mean interrupting running services, losing precious state, or causing downtime. Where development iteration happens in seconds, not minutes. This is the world that ByteHot makes possible.

ByteHot is a JVM agent that enables true hot-swapping of bytecode at runtime—not just method implementations, but comprehensive class evolution with intelligent instance management and bulletproof reliability.

* The Problem: The Restart Tyranny

Every Java developer knows the pain: make a change, stop the application, wait for restart, lose all your carefully crafted state, and start over. For enterprise applications, this means:

- **Development Friction**: Lengthy restart cycles that break flow state
- **Production Constraints**: Planned downtime windows for minor fixes
- **Testing Bottlenecks**: Slow iteration on integration testing
- **Lost Context**: Stateful applications lose precious runtime context

Traditional Java hot-swap is limited to method body changes—add a field, change a method signature, or modify class structure, and you're back to restart hell.

* The ByteHot Solution: Intelligent Runtime Evolution

ByteHot transforms this reality by providing:

** Comprehensive Hot-Swapping
Not just method bodies—ByteHot handles class structural changes, new fields, method signature modifications, and even complex inheritance hierarchy updates.

** Intelligent Instance Management
When classes change, existing instances don't just disappear. ByteHot preserves their state, applies the changes, and ensures they continue functioning with the new class definition.

** Framework Integration
Spring applications? CDI containers? Guice modules? ByteHot understands these frameworks and works with their dependency injection systems, not against them.

** Bulletproof Reliability
Every change is reversible. If something goes wrong, ByteHot can roll back to the exact previous state, maintaining system integrity.

* The Architecture Story: Events, Domains, and Hexagonal Elegance

ByteHot's architecture is a story of careful separation and elegant interaction.

** The Event-Driven Heart
At its core, ByteHot speaks in events:
- A file changes → =ClassFileChanged=
- Bytecode is validated → =BytecodeValidated=
- A class is redefined → =ClassRedefinitionSucceeded=
- Instances are updated → =InstancesUpdated=

Each event tells part of the story, and the system orchestrates these events into a symphony of runtime evolution.

** The Domain's Wisdom
The domain layer contains the essential complexity—the core business logic of hot-swapping:
- *ByteHot aggregate*: The central orchestrator that decides what happens when
- *InstanceTracker*: Knows every living instance and their relationships
- *StatePreserver*: Captures and restores the essence of objects across changes
- *ErrorHandler*: The guardian that ensures nothing breaks beyond repair

** The Hexagonal Shield
Infrastructure concerns are pushed to the edges through a complete Ports and Adapters implementation:
- *ConfigurationPort/Adapter*: Multiple configuration sources (YAML, properties, environment)
- *FileWatcherPort/Adapter*: File system monitoring with pattern matching and recursion
- *InstrumentationPort/Adapter*: JVM instrumentation with safety checks and error handling
- *EventEmitterPort/Adapter*: Event emission to multiple targets (console, files, both)
- *Dynamic Discovery*: Automatic adapter detection and injection at runtime
- The domain remains pure, focused on the essential complexity of hot-swapping

* The Journey: From File to Running Instance

Let's follow a single change through ByteHot's system—a story that happens thousands of times during development, each time in under a second.

** Chapter 1: The Spark of Change
A developer saves a Java file. The IDE compiles it to bytecode. In the background, ByteHot's FileWatcherPort (implemented by FileWatcherAdapter) notices the timestamp change on the =.class= file through NIO-based monitoring with pattern matching.

"Something has changed," the system whispers through domain events.

** Chapter 2: The Validation Gate
The new bytecode enters ByteHot's domain. The BytecodeValidator examines it carefully:
- Is it structurally sound?
- Are the changes compatible with existing instances?
- Will the JVM accept this redefinition?

Only bytecode that passes this rigorous examination proceeds.

** Chapter 3: The Transformation
The HotSwapManager takes control, working through the InstrumentationPort (implemented by InstrumentationAdapter) with the JVM's instrumentation API. In a fraction of a second, the class definition in the JVM's memory is replaced safely with comprehensive error handling.

But this is just the beginning.

** Chapter 4: The Renaissance of Instances
This is where ByteHot's magic truly shines. The InstanceUpdater awakens, working with the InstanceTracker to find every living instance of the changed class.

For each instance:
1. *State Preservation*: The StatePreserver captures the complete state
2. *Framework Coordination*: If the instance is managed by Spring or CDI, ByteHot coordinates with the framework
3. *State Restoration*: The preserved state is carefully applied to the updated instance
4. *Validation*: The system ensures the instance is healthy and consistent

** Chapter 5: The Safety Net
Throughout this journey, the RollbackManager stands ready. If anything goes wrong, it can restore the exact previous state—class definitions, instance states, framework configurations—as if the change never happened. The EventEmitterPort (implemented by EventEmitterAdapter) ensures all events are captured for audit trails and monitoring.

* The Framework Dance: Speaking Every Container's Language

ByteHot doesn't just work with your code—it speaks fluent Spring, CDI, and Guice.

* Video Storyline: The ByteHot Journey in Motion

This section contains prompts for creating a 2-minute video storyline that captures the essence of ByteHot's revolutionary approach to Java development. Each prompt represents an 8-second segment, following the narrative arc and technical precision established throughout this story.

** Segment 1: The Developer's Dilemma (0:00-0:08)
Open with a cinematic split-screen composition showcasing the universal frustration of Java development. On the left, show a professional developer in a modern workspace, fingers hovering over the keyboard after making a critical code change—perhaps fixing a null pointer exception or adding a crucial business logic validation. The IDE shows green compilation success, but the developer's expression shifts to resignation as they initiate the inevitable application restart. On the right side, display a stark loading screen with the dreaded progress bar crawling forward at an agonizingly slow pace. The camera slowly zooms in on a desktop clock showing precious minutes ticking away—the minute hand visibly moves from one position to another in time-lapse fashion. A steaming coffee mug gradually cools, steam disappearing completely, symbolizing the broken flow state. The developer's expression transforms from focused concentration to thumb-twiddling impatience, then to checking their phone, walking away from the desk, and returning to find the application still loading. The scene captures the profound psychological cost of context switching—the moment when creative momentum dies. Background elements should include multiple monitor setups, enterprise Java framework documentation open in browser tabs, and the subtle visual cues of a complex, stateful application dashboard that took considerable effort to reach its current state, all about to be lost in the restart cycle. The developer's body language tells the complete story of disrupted flow.

** Segment 2: The Restart Tyranny (0:08-0:16)
Transform into a rapid-fire montage that viscerally captures the universality of restart-induced friction across enterprise Java development environments. Begin with extreme close-ups of progress bars crawling forward at different percentages, with the bars themselves telling the story through their visual design—Spring's green progress indicator, Maven's orange build progress, application server loading screens with their distinctive colors and animations. Cut between different workspaces: a startup office where developers wait around a ping-pong table while their microservices restart, a corporate environment where a senior architect drums fingers against a mahogany desk as enterprise applications slowly bootstrap, a remote developer in a home office who walks away to make another cup of coffee during the interminable wait. Show IDE console outputs scrolling with familiar patterns—the distinctive visual signatures of framework initialization that every Java developer recognizes through color schemes and layout patterns. Include quick flashes of different applications experiencing data loss: e-commerce platforms showing empty shopping carts where items previously existed, financial applications displaying blank calculation fields where complex data was being processed, IoT dashboards going dark and then slowly repopulating with reset streams. The camera captures the universal body language of Java developers worldwide: head-in-hands, thousand-yard stares, the involuntary reach for mobile phones to fill the void. Each scene transition becomes faster, more frantic, building to a crescendo of collective frustration before cutting to black, emphasizing that this pain transcends company size, project type, and developer experience level.

** Segment 3: ByteHot's Promise (0:16-0:24)
Dramatic tonal shift to showcase ByteHot's revolutionary promise through elegant visual metaphor. Open with the same developer from Segment 1, but now their workspace is transformed by an aura of calm confidence—subtle lighting changes, organized desk setup, relaxed posture. They make a code change—this time adding a new method parameter to handle edge cases—and instead of the resignation we saw before, their expression shows anticipation and excitement. The moment they save the file, magic happens: the change flows like liquid light from the IDE directly into the running application without any loading screens, restart sequences, or interruption. The application's user interface immediately reflects the change—perhaps a new validation field appearing in a form, or updated business logic processing a transaction with visibly different behavior—all while maintaining complete state preservation. Show this as a seamless evolution where the application literally transforms while running, like a butterfly emerging from its chrysalis but never stopping flight. The camera follows the change through transparent, flowing pathways that represent ByteHot's event-driven architecture, with soft blue and green light trails representing domain events moving through the system in a choreographed dance. The developer's expression shows pure joy—eyes lighting up, a genuine smile, the rediscovered pleasure of immediate feedback and unbroken creative flow. The scene should convey through visual storytelling alone that this isn't just a technical improvement, but a restoration of the natural rhythm of thought-to-implementation that makes programming magical. The stark contrast with the previous segment's frustration makes ByteHot's revolutionary nature immediately apparent.

** Segment 4: The Architecture Dance (0:24-0:32)
Transition into an abstract, architecturally sophisticated visualization that showcases ByteHot's hexagonal architecture as a living, breathing organism of elegant software design. The camera pulls back to reveal a three-dimensional architectural model that resembles both a sophisticated building blueprint and a cosmic molecular structure. At the center lies a pristine, glowing hexagonal core representing the Domain layer—completely pure, containing only essential business logic without any infrastructure concerns. This hexagon pulses with warm, intelligent light, representing the beating heart of ByteHot's hot-swapping logic. Surrounding this core, show six distinct ports extending outward like perfectly symmetrical spokes: ConfigurationPort (glowing blue for multiple config sources), FileWatcherPort (green pulses for file system monitoring), InstrumentationPort (orange energy for JVM integration), EventEmitterPort (purple streams for event broadcasting), and others. Each port connects to corresponding adapters in the outer ring, shown as sophisticated interface modules that handle the accidental complexity of infrastructure. Domain events flow like luminous data streams through this architecture: ClassFileChanged events appear as silver ribbons, BytecodeValidated events as golden sparks, ClassRedefinitionSucceeded events as emerald waves. The visualization emphasizes the separation of concerns through distinct visual layers, with clean boundaries that prevent domain contamination. Show the dynamic discovery mechanism as adapter modules automatically connecting to their corresponding ports, creating a self-organizing, intelligent system that embodies the highest principles of software architecture.

** Segment 5: File to Instance Journey (0:32-0:40)
Create an epic, cinematic journey that follows a single code change through ByteHot's complete processing pipeline, transforming abstract technical concepts into a thrilling adventure narrative. Begin with an extreme close-up of a developer's fingertip pressing the 'S' key to save a modified Java file—perhaps changing a critical validation algorithm in a payment processing service. The camera immediately dives into the file system, following the change like a particle of light through fiber optic cables. The modification triggers ByteHot's FileWatcherPort, visualized as an elegant sentinel that instantly detects the timestamp change and emits a ClassFileChanged event, shown as a golden spark that immediately begins moving. This spark travels through ByteHot's hexagonal architecture, reaching the Domain layer where the BytecodeValidator examines it with surgical precision—show this as a sophisticated scanner analyzing the bytecode's molecular structure for compatibility and safety, with multiple colored scanning beams that quickly converge to a single green approval indicator. Upon approval, the change flows to the HotSwapManager, which coordinates with the JVM through the InstrumentationPort, visualized as a delicate surgical operation where class definitions are seamlessly replaced in the JVM's memory through smooth, precise movements. The camera then follows the change to living instances of the modified class, where the InstanceUpdater performs the "Instance Renaissance"—carefully preserving state, applying changes, and validating results through a choreographed transformation sequence. Throughout this journey, show the incredible speed through visual tempo: rapid but smooth movements, quick transitions, pulsing rhythms that suggest sub-second timing. The entire sequence should feel like a precision choreographed ballet where every step is both elegant and purposeful, emphasizing through pure visual storytelling that this lightning-fast journey represents years of sophisticated engineering working in perfect harmony.

** Segment 6: The Validation Gate (0:40-0:48)
Focus intensely on ByteHot's validation process as the crucial quality gate that separates revolutionary capability from reckless chaos. Show this as a high-tech, multi-layered security checkpoint that would feel at home in a sophisticated laboratory or mission control center. The BytecodeValidator appears as an advanced analytical system with multiple scanning layers: structural analysis engines that verify bytecode integrity, compatibility checkers that ensure changes won't break existing instances, and JVM acceptance validators that confirm the instrumentation API will accept the redefinition. Visualize each validation layer as a different colored light spectrum scanning the incoming bytecode—blue light for structural soundness, green light for compatibility analysis, and orange light for JVM acceptance verification. The scanning process should be visually dramatic yet precise, with beams of light moving across the bytecode structure like sophisticated medical imaging equipment. Show failed validations as respectful rejection rather than harsh denial—changes that don't pass are gently returned with warm amber warning lights and graceful redirection pathways that suggest helpful guidance rather than harsh rejection. Successful validations trigger cascading green checkmarks across multiple validation dimensions, each checkpoint lighting up in sequence like a sophisticated security clearance system, each accompanied by subtle, satisfying visual confirmations that pulse and flow. The validation monitors display complex analytical readouts through pure visual elements—waveforms, structural diagrams, compatibility matrices—that convey rigorous engineering without requiring textual explanation. The validation process should appear both incredibly sophisticated and reassuringly thorough, giving viewers confidence that ByteHot's power comes with wisdom and responsibility. Emphasize through visual storytelling that this gate ensures only safe, beneficial changes proceed to the live system.

** Segment 7: Instance Renaissance (0:48-0:56)
Showcase the most magical aspect of ByteHot's capabilities: the graceful transformation of existing instances without losing their essential identity or breaking their relationships. Begin by visualizing a complex application state—perhaps an e-commerce platform with active shopping carts, ongoing transactions, user sessions, and cached data. Show these as living, interconnected entities floating in a digital space, each glowing with the warmth of preserved state and active business logic. When a class change arrives (perhaps adding a new field to the User class for enhanced security features), the InstanceUpdater begins its delicate work. Visualize this as a master craftsperson who understands both the art and science of transformation. First, the StatePreserver captures the complete essence of each instance—not just field values, but relationship mappings, framework bindings, and contextual information—shown as creating luminous backup copies that contain the soul of each object. Next, show framework coordination as ByteHot communicates with Spring (represented by green architectural springs), CDI (shown as interconnected dependency networks), and Guice (visualized as precise injection mechanisms), ensuring each framework remains synchronized with the changes. The transformation itself should appear as a seamless metamorphosis: instances gracefully adopt their new class definition while maintaining their accumulated state, relationships, and business context. Show shopping carts retaining their items, user sessions preserving authentication, and cached calculations remaining valid. The validation phase appears as each transformed instance running through comprehensive health checks, verifying integrity and consistency. Throughout this process, emphasize that no instance loses its identity—they evolve while remaining fundamentally themselves, like biological cells adapting while maintaining life continuity.

** Segment 8: Framework Integration (0:56-1:04)
Illustrate ByteHot's sophisticated framework integration through the metaphor of a master diplomat who speaks every language fluently and understands each culture's unique customs. The scene opens with ByteHot appearing as an elegant, multi-faceted entity surrounded by the distinct architectural patterns of major Java frameworks. When encountering Spring-managed beans, ByteHot transforms to speak "Spring language"—understanding singleton versus prototype scopes (visualized as different geometric patterns), coordinating with Spring's proxy mechanisms (shown as transparent intermediary layers), and integrating with dependency injection containers (represented as flowing connection networks). The camera then shifts to CDI interactions, where ByteHot demonstrates its understanding of contextual boundaries and scopes, shown as respecting invisible dimensional boundaries that represent different CDI contexts. For Guice modules, visualize ByteHot working with binding configurations and provider implementations, maintaining the elegant simplicity that Guice represents through clean, minimalist geometric forms. Each framework interaction should be distinctly styled: Spring with organic, garden-like growth patterns reflecting its comprehensive ecosystem; CDI with precise, standards-based geometric structures representing its specification-driven nature; Guice with clean, functional patterns that embody its lightweight philosophy. Show ByteHot not as a foreign invader forcing change, but as a respectful collaborator that enhances each framework's natural capabilities. The integration appears seamless because ByteHot understands that each framework has evolved its patterns for good reasons, and successful hot-swapping means working with these patterns, not against them. Include visual indicators showing successful coordination: Spring beans refreshing gracefully, CDI contexts maintaining their boundaries, Guice bindings updating smoothly, all while preserving the architectural integrity that makes each framework valuable.

** Segment 9: The Safety Net (1:04-1:12)
Present ByteHot's rollback capabilities as the ultimate confidence builder that enables fearless innovation through comprehensive safety guarantees. The scene opens with a developer contemplating a risky but potentially breakthrough architectural refactoring—perhaps restructuring a critical payment processing algorithm or modifying core security validation logic. Instead of the traditional developer anxiety that accompanies such changes, show calm confidence born from knowing that ByteHot's safety net makes every change reversible. Visualize the snapshot creation process as ByteHot constructing a perfect, crystalline backup of the current system state—not just class bytecode, but complete instance state preservation, framework configuration capture, and dependency relationship mapping. Show this as creating a temporal anchor point, a perfect moment in time that can be instantly restored if needed. The RollbackManager appears as a sophisticated time-travel mechanism, maintaining multiple restore points visualized as glowing checkpoint orbs arranged in a timeline, each with distinct visual signatures that indicate different system states through color, intensity, and structural patterns. When the developer implements their risky change and something doesn't behave as expected—perhaps shown through subtle visual cues like application interface elements behaving unexpectedly or performance metrics showing degradation—the rollback mechanism activates not with panic or emergency procedures, but with the calm precision of a well-designed system returning to a known-good state. Show this restoration as instantaneous—classes reverting to previous definitions, instances restoring their previous state, framework configurations returning to their snapshots—all visualized as the system gracefully flowing backward through its checkpoint timeline until reaching the selected restore point. The developer's expression should transform from initial concern to relief to renewed confidence, knowing they can push boundaries without permanent consequences. Emphasize that this safety net doesn't just prevent disasters; it enables innovation by removing the fear that traditionally constrains developers from attempting bold improvements.

** Segment 10: EventSourcing Revelation (1:12-1:20)
Transform the abstract concept of EventSourcing into a powerful visualization of time-travel debugging and complete system auditability that revolutionizes how developers understand and fix complex applications. The scene begins with a critical production bug that has been plaguing a financial services application—perhaps a rare condition where decimal precision errors cause transaction calculations to fail under specific market conditions. Instead of the traditional debugging nightmare of trying to reproduce ephemeral state, show ByteHot's EventSourcing capabilities as a time machine that has captured every significant event in the application's history. Visualize the event stream as a river of light flowing through time, with each event represented as a distinct, immutable crystal containing complete context information: UserLoginStarted, CalculationInitiated, MarketDataReceived, TransactionValidated, ErrorOccurred. The developer can literally travel backward through time, examining the exact sequence of events that led to the bug. Show this as a cinematic rewind effect where the application state rolls backward, undoing each event until reaching the moment before the error occurred. The bug reproduction becomes trivial—simply replay the captured event sequence, and the error manifests exactly as it did in production, with complete environmental context preserved. Emphasize the transformation from "works on my machine" frustration to perfect reproducibility through visual metaphors: opaque, mysterious bug clouds becoming crystal-clear, illuminated pathways; chaotic debugging sessions becoming precise, surgical analysis; guesswork becoming scientific certainty. The audit trail appears as an elegant timeline showing not just what happened, but who triggered each event, when it occurred, and how it causally connected to subsequent events. This creates unprecedented transparency for enterprise compliance requirements while simultaneously providing developers with debugging superpowers that make complex systems comprehensible and manageable.

** Segment 11: User-Aware Intelligence (1:20-1:28)
Showcase ByteHot's intelligent user awareness as a sophisticated personal assistant that learns, adapts, and optimizes the development experience for each individual developer. The scene opens with ByteHot automatically discovering a new developer's identity through its multi-source recognition system—scanning Git configuration, reading environment variables, detecting email patterns—all without requiring manual setup or configuration. Show this discovery process as elegant detective work: ByteHot scanning through various system sources, correlating information patterns, and gradually building a comprehensive user profile through visual data flows and connection mapping. The user interface transforms to display personal analytics through rich visual dashboards: heat maps showing activity patterns, trend graphs indicating efficiency improvements, visual representations of most frequently modified code areas, and temporal patterns showing productivity rhythms. Visualize ByteHot learning individual workflow patterns through subtle behavioral analysis—recognizing temporal patterns in the developer's work habits, understanding their preferred testing approaches, and identifying their typical session durations through elegant data visualization that shows patterns emerging over time. Show the system adapting accordingly: preloading relevant classes indicated by glowing file icons, suggesting test scenarios through visual pathways and highlighted options, optimizing file watching by focusing illuminated directories that represent frequently modified areas. The personal analytics appear not as invasive monitoring, but as helpful insights that drive continuous improvement: beautiful heat maps showing productivity patterns, elegant suggestion systems that highlight optimization opportunities, celebratory visual indicators for efficiency milestones achieved. Include team coordination features through collaborative avatars: showing who made specific changes through color-coded user indicators, maintaining user context across collaborative sessions with seamless hand-off visualizations, perfect integration for pair programming scenarios with shared context indicators. The intelligence should feel like having a thoughtful pair programming partner who remembers everything, learns continuously, and always looks for ways to reduce friction and enhance productivity.

** Segment 12: Testing Revolution (1:28-1:36)
Present ByteHot's event-driven testing paradigm as a fundamental shift from brittle, artificial test setups to robust, realistic scenario reproduction using actual domain events. Open with a split-screen comparing traditional testing approaches versus ByteHot's event-driven methodology. On the left, show the familiar frustration of mock-heavy testing: developers wrestling with complex mock configurations that appear as tangled webs of artificial connections, tests that pass in isolation but fail in integration shown through fragmented green checkmarks that turn red when combined, brittle assertions that break whenever implementation details change visualized as delicate glass structures shattering. On the right, reveal ByteHot's Given/When/Then framework using real domain events to build authentic system state: elegant, flowing event streams that construct realistic test scenarios, solid foundations built from actual system behavior rather than artificial substitutes. Instead of mocking dependencies, show developers constructing test scenarios using actual domain events—ClassFileChanged, BytecodeValidated, and InstancesUpdated events flowing like building blocks that create authentic system states. Visualize the power of this approach: when a bug occurs in production, ByteHot's EventSourcing automatically captures the complete event sequence, which immediately becomes a failing test case that reproduces the exact problem. Show this transformation as bugs morphing from mysterious, unreproducible shadow creatures into crystalline, documented test scenarios that shine with clarity and understanding. The EventDrivenTestSupport framework appears as elegant scaffolding that provides developers with powerful testing infrastructure while maintaining the simplicity and readability of traditional testing approaches. The living documentation aspect appears as tests that serve dual purposes: they verify system behavior while simultaneously documenting business processes through elegant visual flowcharts that tell coherent stories. These event-driven tests create readable narrative sequences that tell complete stories about user authentication, business processes, and system behavior that remain accurate as the system evolves. Emphasize the reliability improvement: event-driven tests evolve gracefully with the domain model instead of breaking whenever internal implementations change. Show developers gaining confidence as their test suites become more maintainable, more realistic, and more valuable as both verification tools and system documentation. The revolution lies in tests that enhance understanding rather than obscuring it.

** Segment 13: Development Flow State (1:36-1:44)
Capture the psychological transformation that ByteHot enables by contrasting the choppy, frustrating rhythm of traditional Java development with the smooth, unbroken flow state that immediate feedback creates. Begin with a developer deep in creative problem-solving mode—perhaps architecting a complex algorithm for real-time fraud detection. Their expression shows the focused intensity that comes with holding multiple interconnected concepts in working memory: data structures, business rules, edge cases, performance considerations. In traditional development, show how restart cycles shatter this delicate mental state: the moment they save a change and initiate a restart, watch their expression shift from focused concentration to passive waiting, their hands moving away from the keyboard, their mental model beginning to decay during the forced pause. The camera captures micro-expressions of frustration and lost momentum. Cut to the same developer in a ByteHot-enabled environment: they make the same change, but instead of mental disruption, their flow continues uninterrupted. The change appears immediately in their running application, allowing them to build momentum rather than lose it.
