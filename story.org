* The Vision: Code That Evolves While It Runs

Imagine a world where your Java applications don't need to restart to incorporate changes. Where fixing a bug or adding a feature doesn't mean interrupting running services, losing precious state, or causing downtime. Where development iteration happens in seconds, not minutes. This is the world that ByteHot makes possible.

ByteHot is a JVM agent that enables true hot-swapping of bytecode at runtime—not just method implementations, but comprehensive class evolution with intelligent instance management and bulletproof reliability.

* The Problem: The Restart Tyranny

Every Java developer knows the pain: make a change, stop the application, wait for restart, lose all your carefully crafted state, and start over. For enterprise applications, this means:

- **Development Friction**: Lengthy restart cycles that break flow state
- **Production Constraints**: Planned downtime windows for minor fixes
- **Testing Bottlenecks**: Slow iteration on integration testing
- **Lost Context**: Stateful applications lose precious runtime context

Traditional Java hot-swap is limited to method body changes—add a field, change a method signature, or modify class structure, and you're back to restart hell.

* The ByteHot Solution: Intelligent Runtime Evolution

ByteHot transforms this reality by providing:

** Comprehensive Hot-Swapping
Not just method bodies—ByteHot handles class structural changes, new fields, method signature modifications, and even complex inheritance hierarchy updates.

** Intelligent Instance Management
When classes change, existing instances don't just disappear. ByteHot preserves their state, applies the changes, and ensures they continue functioning with the new class definition.

** Framework Integration
Spring applications? CDI containers? Guice modules? ByteHot understands these frameworks and works with their dependency injection systems, not against them.

** Bulletproof Reliability
Every change is reversible. If something goes wrong, ByteHot can roll back to the exact previous state, maintaining system integrity.

* The Architecture Story: Events, Domains, and Hexagonal Elegance

ByteHot's architecture is a story of careful separation and elegant interaction.

** The Event-Driven Heart
At its core, ByteHot speaks in events:
- A file changes → `ClassFileChanged`
- Bytecode is validated → `BytecodeValidated`
- A class is redefined → `ClassRedefinitionSucceeded`
- Instances are updated → `InstancesUpdated`

Each event tells part of the story, and the system orchestrates these events into a symphony of runtime evolution.

** The Domain's Wisdom
The domain layer contains the essential complexity—the core business logic of hot-swapping:
- *ByteHot aggregate*: The central orchestrator that decides what happens when
- *InstanceTracker*: Knows every living instance and their relationships
- *StatePreserver*: Captures and restores the essence of objects across changes
- *ErrorHandler*: The guardian that ensures nothing breaks beyond repair

** The Hexagonal Shield
Infrastructure concerns are pushed to the edges through a complete Ports and Adapters implementation:
- *ConfigurationPort/Adapter*: Multiple configuration sources (YAML, properties, environment)
- *FileWatcherPort/Adapter*: File system monitoring with pattern matching and recursion
- *InstrumentationPort/Adapter*: JVM instrumentation with safety checks and error handling
- *EventEmitterPort/Adapter*: Event emission to multiple targets (console, files, both)
- *Dynamic Discovery*: Automatic adapter detection and injection at runtime
- The domain remains pure, focused on the essential complexity of hot-swapping

* The Journey: From File to Running Instance

Let's follow a single change through ByteHot's system—a story that happens thousands of times during development, each time in under a second.

** Chapter 1: The Spark of Change
A developer saves a Java file. The IDE compiles it to bytecode. In the background, ByteHot's FileWatcherPort (implemented by FileWatcherAdapter) notices the timestamp change on the `.class` file through NIO-based monitoring with pattern matching.

"Something has changed," the system whispers through domain events.

** Chapter 2: The Validation Gate
The new bytecode enters ByteHot's domain. The BytecodeValidator examines it carefully:
- Is it structurally sound?
- Are the changes compatible with existing instances?
- Will the JVM accept this redefinition?

Only bytecode that passes this rigorous examination proceeds.

** Chapter 3: The Transformation
The HotSwapManager takes control, working through the InstrumentationPort (implemented by InstrumentationAdapter) with the JVM's instrumentation API. In a fraction of a second, the class definition in the JVM's memory is replaced safely with comprehensive error handling.

But this is just the beginning.

** Chapter 4: The Renaissance of Instances
This is where ByteHot's magic truly shines. The InstanceUpdater awakens, working with the InstanceTracker to find every living instance of the changed class.

For each instance:
1. *State Preservation*: The StatePreserver captures the complete state
2. *Framework Coordination*: If the instance is managed by Spring or CDI, ByteHot coordinates with the framework
3. *State Restoration*: The preserved state is carefully applied to the updated instance
4. *Validation*: The system ensures the instance is healthy and consistent

** Chapter 5: The Safety Net
Throughout this journey, the RollbackManager stands ready. If anything goes wrong, it can restore the exact previous state—class definitions, instance states, framework configurations—as if the change never happened. The EventEmitterPort (implemented by EventEmitterAdapter) ensures all events are captured for audit trails and monitoring.

* The Framework Dance: Speaking Every Container's Language

ByteHot doesn't just work with your code—it speaks fluent Spring, CDI, and Guice.

** Spring Integration: The Ecosystem Player
When ByteHot encounters Spring-managed beans:
- It understands singleton vs prototype scope
- It refreshes proxy targets without breaking references
- It coordinates with Spring's dependency injection
- It integrates with Spring Boot's development tools

** CDI Coordination: The Standard Bearer
For CDI applications:
- It respects context boundaries and scopes
- It updates contextual instances appropriately
- It maintains qualifier and stereotype semantics
- It fires appropriate CDI events for the changes

** Guice Harmony: The Lightweight Partner
With Guice modules:
- It recreates instances through proper injection
- It maintains binding configurations
- It updates provider implementations
- It preserves singleton semantics

* The Reliability Promise: Never Breaking, Always Recoverable

ByteHot makes a powerful promise: your system will never be left in a broken state.

** The Snapshot Strategy
Before any risky operation, ByteHot creates a comprehensive snapshot:
- Complete class bytecode
- Full instance state preservation
- Framework configuration capture
- Dependency relationship mapping

** The Error Guardian
When things go wrong (and sometimes they do), the ErrorHandler springs into action:
- Classifies the error with surgical precision
- Selects the appropriate recovery strategy
- Coordinates with the RollbackManager if needed
- Ensures the system returns to a consistent state

** The Recovery Arsenal
ByteHot has multiple recovery strategies:
- *Reject Change*: For validation failures
- *Rollback Changes*: For redefinition failures
- *Preserve Current State*: For partial update failures
- *Emergency Shutdown*: For critical system errors
- *Fallback Mode*: For resource exhaustion
