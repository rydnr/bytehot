#+AUTHOR: ByteHot Development Team
#+DATE: [2025-06-19]

* Overview

The ~FlowDiscovered~ event represents the successful identification and analysis of a business flow pattern from a sequence of domain events. This event embodies ByteHot's revolutionary capability to automatically discover and document development workflows through intelligent event pattern analysis.

* Domain Role and Significance

** Self-Documenting System Foundation
FlowDiscovered events enable ByteHot's self-documenting capabilities by transforming observed event patterns into structured business process knowledge. Each discovered flow represents a meaningful development workflow that has been automatically identified and validated.

** Intelligent Pattern Recognition
This event demonstrates ByteHot's machine learning-like capabilities in recognizing recurring patterns in developer behavior and system operations, creating living documentation that evolves with actual usage patterns rather than static documentation that becomes outdated.

** Knowledge Extraction Achievement
FlowDiscovered represents the successful extraction of implicit knowledge from explicit event sequences, transforming raw event data into structured business intelligence about development processes and workflows.

* Event Structure and Properties

** Core Discovery Information
#+BEGIN_SRC java :tangle ../../bytehot/src/main/java/org/acmsl/bytehot/domain/events/FlowDiscovered.java
/**
 * The original analysis request that initiated discovery
 */
FlowAnalysisRequested originalEvent;

/**
 * The discovered flow containing the identified pattern
 */
Flow discoveredFlow;

/**
 * Confidence level of the discovery (0.0 to 1.0)
 */
double confidence;
#+END_SRC

** Evidence and Context
#+BEGIN_SRC java :tangle ../../bytehot/src/main/java/org/acmsl/bytehot/domain/events/FlowDiscovered.java
/**
 * Events that triggered the flow detection
 */
List<VersionedDomainEvent> triggeringEvents;

/**
 * Timestamp when flow was discovered
 */
Instant discoveredAt;
#+END_SRC

* Event Architecture and Relationships

** DomainResponseEvent Implementation
FlowDiscovered implements ~DomainResponseEvent<FlowAnalysisRequested>~, establishing:
- Causal relationship to the analysis request that triggered discovery
- Response event semantics for flow analysis workflows
- Event sourcing compatibility for complete audit trails
- Integration with ByteHot's event-driven architecture

** Preceding Event Integration
#+BEGIN_SRC java
@Override
public FlowAnalysisRequested getPreceding() {
    return originalEvent;
}
#+END_SRC

This relationship enables:
- Complete traceability from analysis request to discovery outcome
- Temporal analysis of discovery latency and efficiency
- Context preservation across the discovery workflow
- Analysis request correlation for performance optimization

* Flow Discovery Process Context

** Analysis Request Fulfillment
FlowDiscovered events represent the successful completion of flow analysis requests:
1. ~FlowAnalysisRequested~ initiates pattern analysis
2. Event sequence analysis identifies potential patterns
3. Pattern validation confirms flow characteristics
4. ~FlowDiscovered~ documents the successful discovery

** Pattern Recognition Achievement
The discovery process involves sophisticated pattern recognition:
#+BEGIN_SRC java
// Discovery process overview:
// 1. Event sequence collection and filtering
// 2. Temporal pattern analysis within time windows
// 3. Structural pattern matching against known templates
// 4. Confidence calculation based on pattern strength
// 5. Flow object creation with discovered characteristics
// 6. FlowDiscovered event emission with complete context
#+END_SRC

* Discovered Flow Integration

** Flow Object Encapsulation
The ~discoveredFlow~ field contains a complete ~Flow~ object with:
- Unique flow identifier for system-wide referencing
- Human-readable name and description
- Event sequence pattern that defines the flow
- Temporal characteristics (minimum events, time windows)
- Quality metrics (confidence thresholds, conditions)

** Flow Characteristics Documentation
Each discovered flow documents specific workflow characteristics:
#+BEGIN_SRC java
// Example discovered flow:
Flow hotSwapCompleteFlow = Flow.builder()
    .flowId(FlowId.of("hot-swap-complete"))
    .name("Complete Hot-Swap Workflow")
    .description("End-to-end hot-swap from file change to instance update")
    .eventSequence(List.of(
        ClassFileChanged.class,
        ClassMetadataExtracted.class,
        BytecodeValidated.class,
        HotSwapRequested.class,
        ClassRedefinitionSucceeded.class,
        InstancesUpdated.class
    ))
    .minimumEventCount(4)
    .maximumTimeWindow(Duration.ofSeconds(30))
    .confidence(0.95)
    .build();
#+END_SRC

* Confidence Level Analysis

** Confidence Calculation
The confidence level represents the statistical reliability of the discovered pattern:
- *1.0*: Perfect pattern match with all expected events in exact sequence
- *0.8-0.9*: High confidence with minor variations or optional events
- *0.6-0.7*: Medium confidence with some pattern noise
- *Below 0.6*: Low confidence requiring additional validation

** Confidence Factors
Multiple factors influence the confidence calculation:
#+BEGIN_SRC java
// Confidence contributing factors:
// - Event sequence completeness (40% weight)
// - Temporal consistency within time windows (25% weight)
// - Pattern occurrence frequency (20% weight)
// - Absence of contradictory events (10% weight)
// - Historical validation accuracy (5% weight)
#+END_SRC

** Confidence-Based Decision Making
Different confidence levels trigger different system behaviors:
#+BEGIN_SRC java
if (confidence >= 0.9) {
    // Automatically integrate discovered flow
    registerFlowForAutoDetection(discoveredFlow);
} else if (confidence >= 0.7) {
    // Suggest flow for manual review
    suggestFlowForReview(discoveredFlow);
} else {
    // Mark as potential pattern requiring more data
    markAsPatternCandidate(discoveredFlow);
}
#+END_SRC

* Triggering Events Analysis

** Event Evidence Collection
The ~triggeringEvents~ list provides complete evidence for the discovery:
- Specific event instances that formed the pattern
- Temporal ordering that demonstrates the flow sequence
- Event metadata that provides additional context
- Causal relationships that validate the pattern logic

** Pattern Validation Support
Triggering events enable pattern validation:
#+BEGIN_SRC java
// Pattern validation using triggering events:
// 1. Verify temporal ordering matches expected sequence
// 2. Confirm all required events are present
// 3. Validate time windows are within acceptable bounds
// 4. Check for pattern consistency across multiple occurrences
#+END_SRC

** Historical Analysis Foundation
The triggering events create a foundation for historical analysis:
- Pattern evolution tracking over time
- Developer workflow optimization insights
- Flow reliability assessment based on historical success
- Anomaly detection through pattern deviation analysis

* Event Processing and Integration

** Flow Registration Process
Discovered flows are integrated into the active flow detection system:
#+BEGIN_SRC java
public void processFlowDiscovery(FlowDiscovered event) {
    Flow flow = event.getDiscoveredFlow();
    
    if (event.getConfidence() >= AUTOMATIC_REGISTRATION_THRESHOLD) {
        flowRegistry.register(flow);
        enableAutoDetection(flow);
        notifyDevelopmentTeam(flow);
    }
    
    updateDiscoveryMetrics(event);
    documentDiscoveredFlow(flow);
    analyzePatternTrends(event.getTriggeringEvents());
}
#+END_SRC

    // Given: Event sequence that forms a valid pattern
    List<VersionedDomainEvent> eventSequence = createHotSwapEventSequence();
    FlowAnalysisRequested analysisRequest = new FlowAnalysisRequested(eventSequence);
    
    // When: Flow analysis is performed
    FlowDiscovered discovery = performFlowAnalysis(analysisRequest);
    
    // Then: Should discover valid flow with high confidence
    assertThat(discovery.getDiscoveredFlow()).isNotNull();
    assertThat(discovery.getConfidence()).isGreaterThan(0.8);
    assertThat(discovery.getTriggeringEvents()).isEqualTo(eventSequence);
}
#+END_SRC

    // Given: Event sequences with varying pattern quality
    List<VersionedDomainEvent> perfectPattern = createPerfectEventSequence();
    List<VersionedDomainEvent> noisyPattern = createNoisyEventSequence();
    
    // When: Flow discovery is performed
    FlowDiscovered perfectDiscovery = analyzeEvents(perfectPattern);
    FlowDiscovered noisyDiscovery = analyzeEvents(noisyPattern);
    
    // Then: Confidence should reflect pattern quality
    assertThat(perfectDiscovery.getConfidence()).isGreaterThan(0.9);
    assertThat(noisyDiscovery.getConfidence()).isLessThan(0.7);
}
