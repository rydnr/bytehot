#+TITLE: ClassFileDeleted - Class File Removal Detection and Cleanup Orchestration Event
#+AUTHOR: ByteHot Development Team
#+DATE: [2025-06-20]

* Overview

The ~ClassFileDeleted~ event serves as ByteHot's comprehensive detection and cleanup orchestration signal for removed .class files, representing the discovery of deleted bytecode artifacts that require intelligent cleanup, state management, and runtime adaptation. This critical domain event provides complete deletion context including file metadata, impact analysis, and cleanup strategy information that enables sophisticated resource management and system consistency maintenance. As the authoritative signal for class file removal in ByteHot's monitoring infrastructure, it triggers comprehensive cleanup workflows while maintaining complete audit trails and supporting intelligent resource reclamation, dependency management, and system state consistency throughout the entire intelligent hot-swap system lifecycle.
