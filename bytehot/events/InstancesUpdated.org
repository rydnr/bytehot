#+TITLE: InstancesUpdated - Instance State Synchronization and Runtime Update Confirmation Event
#+AUTHOR: ByteHot Development Team
#+DATE: [2025-06-20]

* Overview

The ~InstancesUpdated~ event serves as ByteHot's comprehensive instance state synchronization and runtime update confirmation signal, representing the successful update of existing object instances to reflect new class behavior following hot-swap operations. This critical domain event provides complete instance management context including update statistics, state preservation details, and framework integration information that enables sophisticated runtime consistency maintenance. As the final confirmation step in ByteHot's hot-swap workflow, it ensures that all existing instances are properly synchronized with new class definitions while maintaining complete audit trails and supporting advanced instance lifecycle management, memory optimization, and system consistency throughout the entire intelligent hot-swap system lifecycle.

* Domain Architecture Role

InstancesUpdated serves as the comprehensive instance synchronization and state management hub:
- Confirms successful synchronization of existing instances with new class behavior and definitions
- Provides comprehensive state management context for runtime consistency and integrity verification
- Enables sophisticated instance lifecycle management and state preservation strategies
- Acts as the authoritative confirmation that runtime objects reflect updated class definitions

** Runtime Consistency and Integrity Guardian
The event serves as the runtime consistency and integrity guardian:
- Ensures runtime consistency between class definitions and existing object instances
- Provides comprehensive integrity verification for state preservation and behavior updates
- Enables validation of runtime system consistency after hot-swap operations
- Supports sophisticated consistency monitoring and verification processes

** Framework Integration and Lifecycle Management Intelligence
The implementation provides framework integration and lifecycle management capabilities:
- Enables comprehensive framework integration for managed instance lifecycle coordination
- Supports sophisticated lifecycle management strategies for different framework environments
- Provides foundation for advanced integration patterns with dependency injection and management systems
- Enables intelligent coordination with container and orchestration systems
