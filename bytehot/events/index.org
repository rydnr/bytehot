* Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive index of all domain events in the ByteHot system. Each event represents a significant occurrence within the domain that drives ByteHot's event-driven architecture and enables complete auditability through EventSourcing.

* Event Categories and Organization

ByteHot's domain events are organized into logical categories that reflect different aspects of the hot-swap lifecycle and system capabilities.

** File System Monitoring Events

These events capture file system changes that trigger hot-swap operations:

- [[./ClassFileChanged.org][ClassFileChanged]]: Represents detection of a modified .class file, serving as the primary trigger for hot-swap workflows
- [[./ClassFileCreated.org][ClassFileCreated]]: Captures creation of new .class files in monitored directories
- [[./ClassFileDeleted.org][ClassFileDeleted]]: Records removal of .class files from the file system
- [[./ClassFileProcessed.org][ClassFileProcessed]]: Indicates completion of file processing workflow

** Bytecode Analysis and Validation Events

These events represent the analysis and validation of bytecode for hot-swap compatibility:

- [[./ClassMetadataExtracted.org][ClassMetadataExtracted]]: Documents successful extraction and analysis of class metadata
- [[./BytecodeValidated.org][BytecodeValidated]]: Represents successful bytecode validation for hot-swap compatibility
- [[./BytecodeRejected.org][BytecodeRejected]]: Indicates bytecode validation failure with detailed reasoning

** Hot-Swap Operation Events

These events capture the core hot-swap execution process:

- [[./HotSwapRequested.org][HotSwapRequested]]: Initiates actual JVM class redefinition with complete bytecode context
- [[./ClassRedefinitionSucceeded.org][ClassRedefinitionSucceeded]]: Confirms successful JVM class redefinition
- [[./ClassRedefinitionFailed.org][ClassRedefinitionFailed]]: Records hot-swap failure with error context and rollback information

** Instance Management Events

These events manage existing object instances during hot-swap operations:

- [[./InstancesUpdated.org][InstancesUpdated]]: Documents successful update of existing instances with new class behavior
- [[./InstanceUpdateRequested.org][InstanceUpdateRequested]]: Initiates instance state preservation and migration

** System Lifecycle Events

These events manage ByteHot's agent lifecycle and capabilities:

- [[./ByteHotAttachRequested.org][ByteHotAttachRequested]]: Initial agent attachment request to JVM
- [[./ByteHotAgentAttached.org][ByteHotAgentAttached]]: Successful agent attachment with system capabilities
- [[./ByteHotNotStarted.org][ByteHotNotStarted]]: Agent initialization failure or unavailability
- [[./HotSwapCapabilityEnabled.org][HotSwapCapabilityEnabled]]: Hot-swap functionality activation
- [[./WatchPathConfigured.org][WatchPathConfigured]]: File system monitoring configuration establishment

** User Management Events

These events handle user identification, authentication, and session management:

- [[./UserRegistrationRequested.org][UserRegistrationRequested]]: User identity discovery initiation
- [[./UserRegistered.org][UserRegistered]]: Successful user identity establishment
- [[./UserAuthenticationRequested.org][UserAuthenticationRequested]]: User authentication process initiation
- [[./UserAuthenticated.org][UserAuthenticated]]: Successful user authentication completion
- [[./UserSessionStartRequested.org][UserSessionStartRequested]]: Development session initiation request
- [[./UserSessionStarted.org][UserSessionStarted]]: Active development session establishment

** Flow Detection Events

These events enable ByteHot's self-documenting capabilities through pattern recognition:

- [[./FlowAnalysisRequested.org][FlowAnalysisRequested]]: Initiation of event pattern analysis for flow discovery
- [[./FlowDiscovered.org][FlowDiscovered]]: Successful identification of development workflow patterns

** Base Event Infrastructure

These foundational events provide common functionality across the event hierarchy:

- [[./AbstractVersionedDomainEvent.org][AbstractVersionedDomainEvent]]: Base class providing EventSourcing capabilities and event metadata

* Event-Driven Architecture Overview

** Event Flow Patterns

ByteHot's events follow predictable flow patterns that represent complete business processes:

*** Primary Hot-Swap Flow
1. ~ClassFileChanged~ → File system modification detected
2. ~ClassMetadataExtracted~ → Bytecode structure analyzed
3. ~BytecodeValidated~ → Compatibility confirmed
4. ~HotSwapRequested~ → JVM redefinition initiated
5. ~ClassRedefinitionSucceeded~ → Class successfully updated
6. ~InstancesUpdated~ → Existing instances updated

*** User Session Flow
1. ~UserRegistrationRequested~ → User identity discovery
2. ~UserRegistered~ → User identity established
3. ~UserAuthenticationRequested~ → Authentication initiated
4. ~UserAuthenticated~ → Authentication completed
5. ~UserSessionStartRequested~ → Session creation requested
6. ~UserSessionStarted~ → Active session established

*** Flow Detection Pattern
1. ~FlowAnalysisRequested~ → Pattern analysis initiated
2. ~FlowDiscovered~ → Workflow pattern identified and documented

** Event Characteristics

All ByteHot domain events share common characteristics:

- *Immutability*: Events cannot be modified after creation
- *Causality*: Events maintain relationships to preceding events
- *Temporality*: Events include precise timestamp information
- *Versioning*: Events support schema evolution through versioning
- *User Context*: Events include user identity for collaborative scenarios
- *Auditability*: Events provide complete audit trails for compliance

** EventSourcing Integration

ByteHot's events fully support EventSourcing capabilities:
- Complete system state reconstruction from event streams
- Temporal analysis and time-travel debugging
- Event replay for testing and validation
- Audit trails for enterprise compliance
- Causal analysis for performance optimization

* Event Documentation Standards

Each event documentation follows consistent standards:

** Structure Organization
- *Overview*: Purpose and significance within the domain
- *Domain Role*: Position within ByteHot's architecture
- *Event Structure*: Properties and their meanings
- *Event Architecture*: Inheritance and relationships
- *Processing Patterns*: How the event is consumed and processed
- *Testing*: Comprehensive test examples and patterns
- *Performance*: Optimization and scalability considerations
- *Related Documentation*: Cross-references to related components

** Literate Programming Approach
Event documentation uses literate programming techniques:
- Code examples are directly tangled into source files
- Documentation serves as both explanation and implementation guide
- Cross-references maintain consistency across the codebase
- Examples are executable and testable

** Living Documentation
Event documentation evolves with the system:
- Documentation is automatically validated against source code
- Examples are tested as part of the build process
- Cross-references are verified for accuracy
- Documentation reflects actual system behavior

* Testing and Event-Driven Development

ByteHot's event-driven architecture enables revolutionary testing approaches:

** Event-Driven Testing Framework
The EventDrivenTestSupport framework allows testing with real domain events:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
@Test
void shouldCompleteHotSwapWorkflow() {
    given()
        .event(new ClassFileChanged(classPath))
        .event(new BytecodeValidated(classPath, true));
    
    when()
        .event(new HotSwapRequested(classPath, bytecode));
    
    then()
        .expectEvent(ClassRedefinitionSucceeded.class)
        .expectEvent(InstancesUpdated.class);
}
#+END_SRC

** Benefits of Event-Driven Testing
- *Realistic Test Scenarios*: Tests use actual domain events rather than mocks
- *Reliable Test Evolution*: Tests evolve with the domain model
- *Living Documentation*: Tests serve as executable documentation
- *Complete Workflow Testing*: Full event chains can be tested end-to-end

ByteHot's event processing is optimized for performance:
- *Minimal Latency*: Events are processed with sub-second response times
- *Memory Efficiency*: Events use minimal memory footprint
- *Concurrent Processing*: Multiple events can be processed simultaneously
- *Resource Management*: Automatic cleanup prevents resource leaks

** Scalability Considerations
The event system scales effectively:
- *Batch Processing*: Multiple events can be processed together
- *Queue Management*: Event queues prevent processing bottlenecks
- *Load Balancing*: Event processing can be distributed

- *Testing Frameworks*: JUnit, TestNG, and custom test support

** Extensibility Points
The event system provides multiple extensibility points:
- *Custom Events*: New domain events can be easily added
