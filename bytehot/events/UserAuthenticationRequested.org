#+TITLE: UserAuthenticationRequested - User Authentication Request and Security Workflow Initiation Event
#+AUTHOR: ByteHot Development Team
#+DATE: [2025-06-21]

* Overview

The ~UserAuthenticationRequested~ event represents a user authentication request, providing comprehensive authentication context and security workflow initiation for precise user access management and automated authentication coordination.

* Event Structure and Authentication Context

** Core User Authentication Information
#+BEGIN_SRC java :tangle ../../bytehot/src/main/java/org/acmsl/bytehot/domain/events/UserAuthenticationRequested.java
/**
 * User identifier to authenticate for security access management
 * @return the UserId for the authentication request
 */
@Getter
private final UserId userId;
#+END_SRC

** Factory Methods and Authentication Creation
#+BEGIN_SRC java :tangle ../../bytehot/src/main/java/org/acmsl/bytehot/domain/events/UserAuthenticationRequested.java
/**
 * Factory method for new user authentication request with comprehensive context
 * @param userId the user identifier for authentication
 * @return new UserAuthenticationRequested event with complete authentication context
 */
public static UserAuthenticationRequested of(final UserId userId) {
    return new UserAuthenticationRequested(userId);
}

/**
 * Factory method for user authentication from registration workflow
 * @param registeredEvent the registration event that triggered authentication
 * @return new UserAuthenticationRequested event derived from registration
 */
public static UserAuthenticationRequested fromRegistration(final UserRegistered registeredEvent) {
    return of(registeredEvent.getUserProfile().getUserId());
}

* Domain Event Role

This event serves as a DomainEvent that initiates the user authentication workflow, triggering the necessary security processes to authenticate a user in the ByteHot system with appropriate context management and security coordination.

* User Authentication Workflow Initiation

The event enables comprehensive user authentication coordination:
- **User Identification**: Clear user identification through UserId for authentication tracking
- **Security Workflow**: Initiation of authentication processes and security verification
- **Access Management**: Authentication request processing for system access control
- **Context Preservation**: Authentication context preservation for comprehensive security management

* Authentication Intelligence and Security Operations

The event provides intelligent authentication management:
- **Identity Verification**: User identity verification through domain-driven authentication
- **Security Context**: Comprehensive security context establishment for authenticated sessions
- **Access Control**: Authentication-based access control initiation
- **Workflow Coordination**: Security workflow coordination through event-driven architecture

* Implementation Notes

** Design Patterns Applied
The event leverages several sophisticated design patterns:
- **Domain Event Pattern**: Authentication workflow initiation through event-driven architecture
- **Request-Response Pattern**: Authentication request that leads to response events
- **Factory Method Pattern**: Streamlined event creation through static factory methods
- **Security Context Pattern**: Authentication context management and preservation

** Domain-Driven Design Principles
The implementation follows strict DDD principles:
- **Rich Events**: Comprehensive authentication context beyond simple notification
- **Domain Intelligence**: Built-in intelligence for authentication management and security
- **Workflow Coordination**: Clear security workflow initiation through domain events
- **Security-First Design**: Authentication-centric design with comprehensive security context

** Security Considerations
The authentication event maintains security best practices:
- **Identity Protection**: Secure user identity handling and verification
- **Context Security**: Secure authentication context management
- **Access Control**: Authentication-based access control coordination
- **Audit Trail**: Authentication request tracking for security audit and compliance

The UserAuthenticationRequested event provides ByteHot's essential user authentication foundation while maintaining comprehensive security context and workflow coordination for advanced authentication management scenarios.
