This relationship enables:
- Complete traceability from session request to establishment
- Session initialization latency analysis
- Context preservation across session management workflows
- User authentication and authorization correlation

* Session Lifecycle Integration

** Session Request Fulfillment
UserSessionStarted represents the successful completion of session establishment:
1. ~UserSessionStartRequested~ initiates session creation
2. User authentication and authorization verification
3. Session configuration and environment setup
4. ~UserSessionStarted~ confirms successful session establishment

** Session State Management
The event integrates with session state management:
#+BEGIN_SRC java
// Session state transitions:
// REQUESTED → UserSessionStartRequested
// AUTHENTICATING → User authentication process
// CONFIGURING → Session setup and configuration
// ACTIVE → UserSessionStarted (current event)
// ACTIVE → Session continues with development activities
// TERMINATED → UserSessionEnded (future session conclusion)
#+END_SRC

* User Session Information

Primary factory method for session establishment:
#+BEGIN_SRC java :tangle ../../bytehot/src/main/java/org/acmsl/bytehot/domain/events/UserSessionStarted.java
public static UserSessionStarted of(
    final UserSessionStartRequested precedingEvent, 
    final UserSession session
) {
    return new UserSessionStarted(precedingEvent, session);
}
#+END_SRC

** Session Creation Validation
Session creation includes comprehensive validation:
#+BEGIN_SRC java
// Session validation checks:
// - User identity verification and uniqueness
// - Session configuration validity
// - Environment compatibility assessment
// - Resource availability confirmation
// - Security and authorization verification
#+END_SRC

* Event Processing and Integration

** Session Activation Process
UserSessionStarted events trigger session activation:
#+BEGIN_SRC java
public void processSessionStart(UserSessionStarted event) {
    UserSession session = event.getSession();
    
    // 1. Register active session
    sessionRegistry.register(session);
    
    // 2. Initialize user-specific configuration
    configurationManager.loadUserConfiguration(session.getUserId());
    
    // 3. Setup analytics and tracking
    analyticsService.initializeUserTracking(session);
    
    // 4. Notify interested components
    notifySessionObservers(session);
    
    // 5. Begin activity monitoring
    activityMonitor.startTracking(session);
}
#+END_SRC
