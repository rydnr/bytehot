/**
 * Test that detects the critical file watching bug in ByteHot.
 * 
 * **The Bug**: ByteHot.start() emits WatchPathConfigured events but never 
 * calls FileWatcherPort.startWatching() to actually begin monitoring files.
 * 
 * **Expected Behavior**: When ByteHot.start() is called with a configuration
 * containing folders to watch, it should call FileWatcherPort.startWatching()
 * for each configured folder.
 * 
 * **Current Buggy Behavior**: Events are emitted but file watching never starts.
