#+AUTHOR: Claude Code & User
#+DATE: 2025-06-17

* Introduction

This document chronicles the development journey of ByteHot, a JVM agent that enables bytecode hot-swapping at runtime. The project follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Hexagonal Architecture principles, with strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology.

* Project Overview

ByteHot is designed as a modular system consisting of:
- */java-commons*: Support project for consistency and shared utilities
- */bytehot*: Main project implementing the JVM agent for runtime bytecode hot-swapping

The architecture follows three distinct layers:
- *Domain Layer*: Core business logic, aggregates, entities, value objects
- *Application Layer*: Event routing and port/adapter coordination  
- *Infrastructure Layer*: Technology-specific implementations

* Development Journey

** Session Context
The current session continued from previous work where Milestones 1-3 were already completed:
- âœ… Milestone 1: File System Monitoring
- âœ… Milestone 2: Bytecode Analysis  
- âœ… Milestone 3: Hot-Swap Operations

The user explicitly requested to continue with *Milestone 4: Instance Management*.

** Milestone 4: Instance Management (COMPLETED)

*** User Request
The user asked to "Please continue with Milestone 4" - implementing instance management functionality for tracking and updating existing instances after class redefinition.

*** Critical Feedback on TDD Methodology
The user provided crucial feedback: "you are not creating any commits, and thus you are not following the expected TDD workflow, right?"

This led to a significant course correction where I:
1. Created 15 retrospective commits for all previous work
2. Adopted proper TDD workflow going forward
3. Used emoji-based commit messages as specified in CLAUDE.md

*** Implementation Details
I implemented 6 core components plus integration tests:

**** Core Classes Implemented:
1. *InstanceUpdateMethod* - Enum with 5 update strategies (AUTOMATIC, REFLECTION, PROXY_REFRESH, FACTORY_RESET, NO_UPDATE)
2. *InstancesUpdated* - Domain event capturing comprehensive update metrics  
3. *InstanceTracker* - Thread-safe instance tracking using weak references
4. *InstanceUpdater* - Core coordinator for instance updates after redefinition
5. *InstanceUpdateException* - Error handling for update failures
6. *StatePreserver* - Object state management using reflection

**** Supporting Components:
7. *InstanceManagementIntegrationTest* - End-to-end validation
8. *FrameworkIntegration* - Spring-style factory patterns for DI frameworks

*** TDD Workflow Applied
Following the user's feedback, I implemented proper TDD methodology:
- ðŸ§ª *:test-tube:* - New failing test commits
- âœ… *:white-check-mark:* - Working implementation commits  
- ðŸš€ *:rocket:* - Refactoring commits (when needed)

*** Results
- *15 commits* created following TDD methodology
- *41/41 tests passing* across all components
- Full instance management functionality implemented
- Thread-safe concurrent programming with memory management
- Event-driven architecture with comprehensive metrics

** Milestone 5: Error Handling and Recovery â†’ Hexagonal Architecture (COMPLETED)

*** User Request Progression
After completing Milestone 4, the user requested: "Great! Thank you! Can you proceed to Milestone 5?"

Initially this began as error handling and recovery implementation, but evolved into a comprehensive hexagonal architecture implementation following user feedback about missing architectural boundaries.

*** Phase 4: Hexagonal Architecture Implementation (COMPLETED)

Following user feedback about architectural compliance, I pivoted to complete the hexagonal architecture implementation:

**** Critical User Feedback
The user asked: "Can you review CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md and check if the codebase fully respects those guidelines?"

This led to a comprehensive compliance analysis that revealed missing hexagonal architecture components, specifically the Ports and Adapters pattern.

**** User Direction on IoC/DI
The user provided key guidance: "Caveat: The Inversion of Control / Dependency Injection should be the responsibility of the application layer" and explicitly requested: "Please go on tuning the hexagonal architecture and discovering adapters dynamically."

**** Hexagonal Architecture Components Implemented:

***** Domain Layer - Port Interfaces:
1. *ConfigurationPort* - Abstract configuration loading operations from multiple sources
2. *FileWatcherPort* - Abstract file system watching operations with pattern matching  
3. *InstrumentationPort* - Abstract JVM instrumentation operations for class redefinition
4. *EventEmitterPort* - Abstract event emission operations to various targets

***** Infrastructure Layer - Adapter Implementations:
1. *ConfigurationAdapter* - Loads config from YAML, properties, environment variables with intelligent fallbacks
2. *FileWatcherAdapter* - NIO-based file system monitoring with recursive watching and pattern matching

** Milestone 6A: Basic EventSourcing Infrastructure (COMPLETED)

*** User Request Continuation
After completing the hexagonal architecture, the user requested to continue with EventSourcing capabilities, moving from traditional architecture to an event-driven foundation. The user provided detailed guidance:
- Implement "poor-man's" EventStore with filesystem structure
- Add event versioning for EventSourcing needs  
- Follow walking skeleton approach with incremental value
- Use "Flow" concept instead of "Use Case" for emergent business processes

*** Implementation Challenge: Domain Purity
A critical challenge emerged during implementation when Jackson serialization required infrastructure annotations on domain events. Following DDD principles, I needed to maintain domain layer purity.

**** User Guidance on Separation
The user provided crucial feedback: "Sorry, we cannot use @JsonProperty annotations on the domain. If you need them, you'll need to create a subclass of the event in the infrastructure layer, so the domain is unaware of those implementation details."

This led to implementing the DTO pattern in the infrastructure layer.

*** Core Components Implemented

**** Domain Layer - EventSourcing Interfaces:
1. *EventStorePort* - Core EventSourcing operations (save, retrieve, versioning)
2. *VersionedDomainEvent* - Interface extending DomainEvent with EventSourcing metadata
3. *AbstractVersionedDomainEvent* - Base implementation with factory methods
4. *EventMetadata* - Value object containing EventSourcing metadata with factory patterns
5. *Enhanced ClassFileChanged* - Domain event implementing VersionedDomainEvent

**** Infrastructure Layer - Concrete Implementations:
1. *FilesystemEventStoreAdapter* - "Poor-man's" EventStore using filesystem structure
2. *JsonClassFileChanged* - DTO for clean domain-infrastructure separation  
3. *EventSerializationSupport* - JSON serialization with DTO conversion patterns
4. *Enhanced integration* - Updated existing infrastructure adapters for EventSourcing

*** Technical Solutions

**** DTO Pattern for Domain Purity:
- *JsonClassFileChanged* DTO in infrastructure layer with Jackson annotations
- *Conversion methods* (fromDomain/toDomain) for seamless translation
- *EventSerializationSupport* handles DTO conversion automatically
- *Domain layer remains pure* with no infrastructure dependencies

**** Filesystem EventStore Design:
- *Structure*: `eventstore/[aggregate-type]/[aggregate-id]/[timestamp-event].json`
- *Thread-safe operations* with proper concurrent access
- *Filesystem-safe paths* by encoding special characters in aggregate IDs
- *Event ordering* maintained through timestamp-based file naming
- *Metadata tracking* for aggregate versions and event counts

**** EventSourcing Metadata:
- *Event versioning* with aggregate version tracking  
- *Causality chains* linking related events via previousEventId
- *User context* tracking for audit and authorization
- *Correlation IDs* for tracing related operations across system
- *Schema versioning* for future event evolution

*** Testing and Verification
