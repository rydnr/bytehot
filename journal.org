#+DATE: 2025-06-17

* Introduction

This document chronicles the development journey of ByteHot, a JVM agent that enables bytecode hot-swapping at runtime. The project follows Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Hexagonal Architecture principles, with strict Test-Driven Development (TDD) methodology.

* Project Overview

ByteHot is designed as a modular system consisting of:
- */java-commons*: Support project for consistency and shared utilities
- */bytehot*: Main project implementing the JVM agent for runtime bytecode hot-swapping

The architecture follows three distinct layers:
- *Domain Layer*: Core business logic, aggregates, entities, value objects
- *Application Layer*: Event routing and port/adapter coordination  
- *Infrastructure Layer*: Technology-specific implementations

* Development Journey

*** Phase 4: Hexagonal Architecture Implementation (COMPLETED)

Following user feedback about architectural compliance, I pivoted to complete the hexagonal architecture implementation:

**** Critical User Feedback
The user asked: "Can you review CLAUDE.md and AGENTS.md and check if the codebase fully respects those guidelines?"

This led to a comprehensive compliance analysis that revealed missing hexagonal architecture components, specifically the Ports and Adapters pattern.

**** User Direction on IoC/DI
The user provided key guidance: "Caveat: The Inversion of Control / Dependency Injection should be the responsibility of the application layer" and explicitly requested: "Please go on tuning the hexagonal architecture and discovering adapters dynamically."

**** Hexagonal Architecture Components Implemented:

** Milestone 6A: Basic EventSourcing Infrastructure (COMPLETED)

*** User Request Continuation
After completing the hexagonal architecture, the user requested to continue with EventSourcing capabilities, moving from traditional architecture to an event-driven foundation. The user provided detailed guidance:
- Implement "poor-man's" EventStore with filesystem structure
- Add event versioning for EventSourcing needs  
- Follow walking skeleton approach with incremental value
- Use "Flow" concept instead of "Use Case" for emergent business processes

*** Implementation Challenge: Domain Purity
A critical challenge emerged during implementation when Jackson serialization required infrastructure annotations on domain events. Following DDD principles, I needed to maintain domain layer purity.

**** User Guidance on Separation
The user provided crucial feedback: "Sorry, we cannot use @JsonProperty annotations on the domain. If you need them, you'll need to create a subclass of the event in the infrastructure layer, so the domain is unaware of those implementation details."

This led to implementing the DTO pattern in the infrastructure layer.

*** Core Components Implemented

**** Domain Layer - EventSourcing Interfaces:
1. *EventStorePort* - Core EventSourcing operations (save, retrieve, versioning)
2. *VersionedDomainEvent* - Interface extending DomainEvent with EventSourcing metadata
3. *AbstractVersionedDomainEvent* - Base implementation with factory methods

1. *FilesystemEventStoreAdapter* - "Poor-man's" EventStore using filesystem structure
2. *JsonClassFileChanged* - DTO for clean domain-infrastructure separation  
3. *EventSerializationSupport* - JSON serialization with DTO conversion patterns
4. *Enhanced integration* - Updated existing infrastructure adapters for EventSourcing

*** Technical Solutions

**** DTO Pattern for Domain Purity:
- *JsonClassFileChanged* DTO in infrastructure layer with Jackson annotations
- *Conversion methods* (fromDomain/toDomain) for seamless translation
- *EventSerializationSupport* handles DTO conversion automatically
- *Domain layer remains pure* with no infrastructure dependencies

**** Filesystem EventStore Design:
- *Structure*: =eventstore/[aggregate-type]/[aggregate-id]/[timestamp-event].json=
- *Thread-safe operations* with proper concurrent access
- *Filesystem-safe paths* by encoding special characters in aggregate IDs

The user requested: "translate the specs files to org format, and update the Github Action 'documentation' workflow if needed? I prefer org-mode to markdown unless absolutely necessary such as READMEs."

I successfully converted all 12 milestone specification files from Markdown to Org-mode format:
- =github-actions-cicd.md= → =github-actions-cicd.org=
- =milestone-1-file-system-monitoring.md= → =milestone-1-file-system-monitoring.org=
- =milestone-2-bytecode-analysis.md= → =milestone-2-bytecode-analysis.org=
- =milestone-3-hotswap-operations.md= → =milestone-3-hotswap-operations.org=

**** Request: Compilation Warning Fixes
The user asked: "There're compilation warnings both in java-commons and bytehot. Can you review them and fix them if possible?"

I systematically fixed all compilation warnings across both modules:

***** Java Commons Fixes:
- *Lombok conflicts* in =SimpleOperationResult.java= - Removed duplicate =@Getter= annotations
- *Unchecked cast warnings* in =CachingPortResolver.java= and =ToStringUtils.java= - Added proper =@SuppressWarnings= annotations
- *Raw type warnings* in =UniqueLogFactory.java= - Added proper type parameters (=Class<?>= instead of =Class=)

***** ByteHot Fixes:
- *Lombok conflict* in =HotSwapRequested.java= - Removed duplicate =@Getter= on =preceding= field
- *Varargs heap pollution warning* in =FlowSearchCriteria.java= - Added =@SuppressWarnings("varargs")= annotation

***** Results:
- Clean compilation with no warnings or errors
- Only remaining messages are informational annotation processor notes
- Improved code quality while maintaining all functionality

**** Request: Framework Extraction Completion
The user requested to "create a commit with this changes" for remaining uncommitted framework work.

I completed the java-commons framework extraction with these additions:

***** EventSourcing Infrastructure:
- =VersionedDomainEvent= interface for event sourcing patterns
- =EventMetadata= for comprehensive event sourcing metadata  
- =AbstractVersionedDomainEvent= base implementation

***** Result & Error Handling Frameworks:
- =OperationResult= interface for generic success/failure semantics
