* Milestone 6D: Event-Driven Bug Reporting

** Objective
Transform exception handling by including complete event context for reproduction, making every bug a reproducible test case through comprehensive event history capture.

** Walking Skeleton Value
Every bug becomes a reproducible test case with complete environmental context, eliminating "works on my machine" problems and enabling precise bug reproduction for faster resolution.

** Key Components

*** 1. EventSnapshotException
- **Purpose**: Enhanced exception that captures complete event history leading to the error
- **Features**:
  - Automatic event history capture from EventSourcing infrastructure
  - Causal chain analysis showing which events led to the exception
  - Environmental context preservation (user, session, system state)
  - Serializable format for bug reports and reproduction
  - Integration with existing error handling infrastructure

*** 2. Automatic Event Snapshot Generation
- **Purpose**: Transparent capture of event context when errors occur
- **Features**:
  - Automatic triggering on any unhandled exception
  - Configurable depth for event history capture
  - Performance-optimized to minimize overhead
  - Smart filtering to include only relevant events
  - Integration with ErrorHandler and RecoveryStrategy patterns

*** 3. Bug Report Serialization and Reproduction
- **Purpose**: Convert event snapshots into reproducible test scenarios
- **Features**:
  - JSON/XML serialization of complete event context
  - Test case generation from captured event sequences
  - Environment reconstruction capabilities
  - Integration with event-driven testing framework
  - Version-aware reproduction across code changes

*** 4. Developer-Friendly Error Reporting
- **Purpose**: Present complex event context in understandable formats
- **Features**:
  - Human-readable error descriptions with event timeline
  - Visual event flow diagrams for complex scenarios
  - Suggested debugging steps based on event patterns
  - Integration with IDE tools and logging frameworks
  - Correlation with documentation and known issues

** Technical Architecture

*** EventSnapshotException Design
#+begin_src java
public class EventSnapshotException extends Exception {
    private final EventSnapshot eventSnapshot;
    private final ErrorContext errorContext;
    private final CausalChain causalChain;
    
    // Methods for reproduction, serialization, and analysis
}
#+begin_src

*** Event Snapshot Structure
- **Event History**: Ordered list of events leading to the error
- **System State**: Snapshot of relevant aggregate states
- **User Context**: User information and session details
- **Environment**: Runtime environment and configuration
- **Timing Information**: Precise timing and sequence data

*** Integration Points
- **Error Handler**: Enhance existing error handling with event capture
- **Event Store**: Leverage existing EventSourcing infrastructure
- **Testing Framework**: Generate reproducible test cases
- **Logging Systems**: Integrate with existing logging infrastructure

** Implementation Strategy

*** Phase 1: Core Exception Infrastructure
1. Implement =EventSnapshotException= with basic event capture
2. Integrate with existing =ErrorHandler= infrastructure
3. Create event snapshot serialization mechanisms
4. Add automatic snapshot generation on errors

*** Phase 2: Enhanced Context Capture
1. Implement causal chain analysis
2. Add intelligent event filtering
3. Enhance environmental context capture
4. Optimize performance for production use

*** Phase 3: Reproduction and Testing Integration
1. Create test case generation from snapshots
2. Implement environment reconstruction
3. Integrate with event-driven testing framework
4. Add version-aware reproduction capabilities

*** Phase 4: Developer Experience
1. Implement human-readable error reporting
2. Create IDE integration tools
3. Add visual debugging aids
4. Enhance documentation integration

** Success Criteria

*** Performance Requirements
- [ ] Event capture adds less than 5ms overhead to exception handling
- [ ] Memory usage remains bounded even with large event histories
- [ ] Serialization completes within 100ms for typical scenarios
- [ ] Production performance impact is negligible

*** Quality Requirements
- [ ] 100% of uncaught exceptions include event context
- [ ] Event snapshots reproduce bugs with 95%+ fidelity
- [ ] Error reports are comprehensible to developers
- [ ] Integration doesn't break existing error handling
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage for all snapshot scenarios
