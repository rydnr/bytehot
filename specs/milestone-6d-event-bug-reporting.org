* Milestone 6D: Event-Driven Bug Reporting
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: milestone-6d-event-driven-bug-reporting
:END:
** Objective
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: objective
:END:
Transform exception handling by including complete event context for
reproduction, making every bug a reproducible test case through
comprehensive event history capture.

** Walking Skeleton Value
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: walking-skeleton-value
:END:
Every bug becomes a reproducible test case with complete environmental
context, eliminating "works on my machine" problems and enabling precise
bug reproduction for faster resolution.
