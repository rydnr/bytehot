* Milestone 7: Documentation Introspection System - Runtime Self-Documentation and Flow-Aware Help

*Revolutionary documentation introspection system enabling runtime Flow detection and contextual documentation access*

** Overview: Building Self-Documenting Runtime Capabilities

The Documentation Introspection System represents a revolutionary approach to runtime self-awareness and contextual help in ByteHot. This milestone transforms ByteHot from a hot-swap tool into a self-documenting system that understands its own operational context and provides intelligent, contextual documentation access during development and testing workflows.

*** Walking Skeleton Value Proposition

This milestone delivers immediate value through:
- **Real-time Documentation Access**: Developers get contextual documentation during manual testing
- **Flow-Aware Help System**: Automatic detection of current operational context (Flow)
- **Enhanced Testing Experience**: Step-by-step manual testing with live documentation links
- **Foundation for Interactive Capabilities**: Prepares for future server socket/protocol integration

*** Domain Events Architecture

Three new domain events capture the documentation introspection workflow:

#### Primary Documentation Events
- **DocumentationRequested**: When a component requests its documentation URL
- **FlowContextDetected**: When runtime Flow context is identified
- **DocumentationLinkGenerated**: When contextual documentation URL is created

*** Core Components and Responsibilities

#### DocLinkAvailable Interface (Domain)
- Provides documentation access methods with minimal code pollution
- Default method implementations delegate to centralized DocProvider
- Methods: =getDocUrl()=, =getMethodDocUrl(String)=, =getRuntimeDocLink()=

#### DocProvider Class (Infrastructure)  
- Centralized documentation URL generation and Flow detection engine
- Analyzes runtime context to determine current operational Flow
- Generates contextual documentation links based on detected Flow

#### Enhanced Defaults Interface (Domain)
- Documentation base URL constants for GitHub Pages integration
- Flow documentation path constants
- Configuration for documentation system behavior

** Technical Architecture and Design Patterns

*** Minimal Code Pollution Strategy

The design uses interface default methods to avoid polluting existing classes:

#+begin_src java
public interface DocLinkAvailable {
    default String getDocUrl() {
        return DocProvider.getDocumentationUrl(this.getClass());
    }
    
    default String getMethodDocUrl(final String methodName) {
        return DocProvider.getMethodDocumentationUrl(this.getClass(), methodName);
    }
    
    default String getRuntimeDocLink() {
        return DocProvider.getRuntimeFlowDocumentationUrl(this);
    }
}
#+begin_src

*** Flow Detection Engine Architecture

#### Runtime Context Analysis
The Flow detection engine analyzes multiple sources to determine operational context:
- **Call Stack Analysis**: Examine current execution stack for Flow patterns
- **Domain Event Context**: Track recent domain events to identify active Flows
- **Configuration State**: Determine if configuration management operations are active
- **File System Operations**: Detect file watching and change detection activities

#### Flow Confidence Scoring
Each Flow detection includes confidence scoring:
- **High Confidence (0.8-1.0)**: Clear Flow pattern detected with multiple indicators
- **Medium Confidence (0.5-0.7)**: Probable Flow with some ambiguity
- **Low Confidence (0.0-0.4)**: Uncertain or no clear Flow pattern

*** Documentation URL Generation Strategy

#### Base URL Configuration
Documentation URLs built from configurable base paths:
- =DOCUMENTATION_BASE_URL=: GitHub Pages documentation root
- =FLOWS_BASE_URL=: Flow-specific documentation path
- =CLASSES_BASE_URL=: Class documentation path

#### Contextual URL Construction
URLs generated based on runtime context:
- **Class Documentation**: Links to literate programming docs for specific classes
- **Method Documentation**: Deep links to method-specific sections
- **Flow Documentation**: Contextual links to current operational Flow documentation

** Implementation Phases and Walking Skeleton Approach

** Integration with Existing ByteHot Architecture

*** Domain-Driven Design Integration
#### Domain Layer Purity
- =DocLinkAvailable= interface remains in domain layer
- No infrastructure dependencies in documentation interfaces
- Documentation concerns separated from core business logic

#### Application Layer Coordination
- Documentation requests routed through application layer
- Integration with existing event routing mechanisms
- Coordination with adapter discovery and injection

#### Infrastructure Layer Implementation
- =DocProvider= class handles complex URL generation logic
- Flow detection engine manages technical implementation details
- Integration with file system monitoring and event emission

*** Event-Driven Architecture Enhancement
#### Documentation Events in Event Flow
New documentation events integrate with existing event architecture:
#+begin_src
File Change → ClassFileChanged → DocumentationRequested → FlowContextDetected → DocumentationLinkGenerated
#+begin_src

#### Event Sourcing Integration
Documentation events participate in EventSourcing:
- Complete audit trail of documentation access patterns
- User-specific documentation usage analytics
- Historical analysis of Flow detection accuracy

*** Hexagonal Architecture Boundaries
#### Port-Adapter Pattern for Documentation
- Documentation access through well-defined ports
- Multiple adapter implementations possible (GitHub Pages, local docs, etc.)
- Clean separation between documentation concerns and core functionality

** Advanced Flow Detection Capabilities

*** Multi-Source Context Analysis

#### Call Stack Pattern Recognition
#+begin_src java
// Example Flow detection from call stack
ConfigurationManagementFlow detected when stack contains:
- ConfigurationAdapter.loadWatchConfiguration()
- WatchConfiguration.load()
- ByteHotCLI.premain()
#+begin_src

#### Domain Event Sequence Analysis
Flow detection analyzes recent domain event sequences:
- **File Change Flow**: ClassFileChanged → ClassMetadataExtracted → BytecodeValidated
- **Hot-Swap Flow**: HotSwapRequested → ClassRedefinitionSucceeded → InstancesUpdated
- **Configuration Flow**: ByteHotAttachRequested → ConfigurationLoaded → WatchPathConfigured

#### Time-Window Analysis
Flow detection considers temporal context:
- Recent events within configurable time window (default: 30 seconds)
- Event sequence patterns indicating specific Flows
- Concurrent Flow detection when multiple processes active

*** Confidence Scoring Algorithm

#### Multi-Factor Confidence Calculation
#+begin_src java
// Confidence scoring factors
final double callStackWeight = 0.4;
final double eventSequenceWeight = 0.3;
final double temporalWeight = 0.2;
final double contextWeight = 0.1;

final double confidence = (callStackScore * callStackWeight) +
                         (eventSequenceScore * eventSequenceWeight) +
                         (temporalScore * temporalWeight) +
                         (contextScore * contextWeight);
#+begin_src

#### Adaptive Learning Potential
Framework designed for future machine learning integration:
- Historical Flow detection accuracy tracking
- User feedback on documentation relevance
- Adaptive confidence threshold adjustment

** Manual Testing Enhancement Strategy

*** Progressive Testing with Documentation Access

#### Phase-Based Testing with Contextual Help
Each testing phase enhanced with documentation introspection:
- **Phase 1 Testing**: Basic infrastructure with core component documentation
- **Phase 2 Testing**: File monitoring with File Watcher Flow documentation  
- **Phase 3 Testing**: Hot-swap operations with Hot-Swap Flow documentation
- **Advanced Phases**: Complex scenarios with multi-Flow documentation

#### Real-Time Documentation Integration
#+begin_src java
// Example manual testing step with documentation
public class ManualTestStep {
    private final String stepDescription;
    private final String expectedOutcome;
    private final String relevantDocumentationUrl;
    
    public void executeWithDocumentation() {
        System.out.println("Step: " + stepDescription);
        System.out.println("Expected: " + expectedOutcome);
        System.out.println("Documentation: " + relevantDocumentationUrl);
        // ... execute step
    }
}
#+begin_src
