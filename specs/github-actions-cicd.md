   - Configure Maven dependency caching
   - Verify build environment
   ```

2. **Build and Test**
   ```yaml

   - Generate test reports (JUnit XML/HTML)
   - Upload test results as artifacts
   ```

3. **Code Quality Analysis**
   ```yaml
   - SpotBugs static analysis

   - OWASP dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Upload quality reports
   ```

4. **Artifact Management**
   ```yaml

   - Code quality analysis reports
   - Security vulnerability reports
   ```

### Continuous Deployment Pipeline

#### Release Triggers
- **Milestone Tags:** `milestone-6A`, `milestone-6B`, etc.
- **Version Tags:** `v1.0.0`, `v1.1.0`, etc.

#### Release Workflow Steps

1. **Pre-Release Validation**
   ```yaml
   - Full build and test execution
   - Version extraction from tag
   - Release artifact preparation
   ```

2. **Artifact Creation**
   ```yaml
   - Package JAR files
   - Create distribution archives
   - Generate checksums
   - Prepare release assets
   ```

3. **Release Notes Generation**
   ```yaml
   - Extract commits since last release
   - Generate structured release notes
   - Include technical details
   - Add installation instructions
   ```

4. **GitHub Release Creation**
   ```yaml
   - Create release with generated notes
   - Upload JAR artifacts
   - Mark milestone releases as pre-release
   - Update release pointers
   ```

## Implementation Details

### Maven Configuration

**Java Version:** 17 (configured in parent POM)
**Build Tool:** Maven 3.9+
**Dependencies:** Cached in `~/.m2/repository`

### Caching Strategy

```yaml
Cache Key: ${{ runner.os }}-maven-${{ hashFiles('**/pom.xml') }}
Cache Paths:
  - ~/.m2/repository
Restore Keys:
  - ${{ runner.os }}-maven-
```

### Security Considerations

- **Token Permissions:** `contents: write` for releases
- **Dependency Scanning:** OWASP dependency check
- **Vulnerability Reports:** Automated security analysis
- **Secrets Management:** GitHub tokens and credentials

### Performance Optimizations

- **Parallel Builds:** Maven `-B` flag for batch mode
- **Dependency Pre-download:** Cached Maven repository
- **Selective Triggers:** Branch and path-based filtering
- **Artifact Compression:** Efficient upload/download

## File Structure

```
.github/
└── workflows/
    ├── ci.yml          # Continuous Integration
    └── release.yml     # Release Management
```

### CI Workflow (`ci.yml`)

```yaml
name: Continuous Integration
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:              # Build and test job
  code-quality:      # Code analysis job
```

### Release Workflow (`release.yml`)

```yaml
name: Release
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - 'milestone-*'
      - 'v*'

jobs:
  release:           # Release creation job
```

## Developer Workflow

### Regular Development

1. **Create Feature Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/new-capability
   ```

2. **Develop with TDD**
   ```bash
   # Follow ByteHot TDD methodology
   git commit -m "🧪 [#issue] failing test for new feature"
   git commit -m "✅ [#issue] implement feature with passing tests"
   git commit -m "🚀 [#issue] refactor and optimize implementation"
   ```

3. **Create Pull Request**
   - CI automatically runs on PR creation
   - All tests must pass before merge
   - Code quality checks must pass

### Milestone Release

1. **Complete Milestone**
   ```bash
   # Ensure all tests pass locally
   mvn clean test
   ```

2. **Create Milestone Tag**
   ```bash
   git tag milestone-6A
   git push origin milestone-6A
   ```

3. **Automated Release**
   - Release workflow automatically triggers
   - Builds, tests, and creates GitHub release
   - Artifacts uploaded with release notes

### Version Release

1. **Stable Release**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **Production Release**
   - Full release (not pre-release)
   - Complete documentation
   - Production-ready artifacts

## Monitoring and Reporting

### Build Status
- **Badge Integration:** README status badges
- **Notification:** Email/Slack integration (configurable)
- **Dashboard:** GitHub Actions dashboard

### Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage:** Tracked in artifacts
- **Code Quality:** SpotBugs/PMD reports
- **Security:** OWASP vulnerability reports
- **Performance:** Build time tracking

### Release Metrics
- **Release Frequency:** Milestone-based releases
- **Artifact Size:** JAR file size tracking
- **Download Statistics:** GitHub release analytics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Build Failures**
   - Check Java version compatibility
   - Verify Maven dependency resolution
   - Review test failures in artifacts

2. **Release Issues**
   - Ensure proper tag naming convention
   - Verify GitHub token permissions
   - Check artifact generation

3. **Performance Issues**
   - Monitor cache hit rates
   - Optimize dependency resolution
   - Review parallel build settings
