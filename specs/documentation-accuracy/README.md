#+TITLE: Documentation Accuracy Fixes
#+AUTHOR: Claude Code
#+DATE: 2025-06-21

* Overview

This directory contains specifications and fixes for documentation accuracy issues discovered during manual testing of the ByteHot GETTING_STARTED guide. The primary focus is ensuring that all documented configuration examples work correctly with the actual implementation.

* Issues Identified

During manual testing following the GETTING_STARTED guide, several critical configuration loading bugs were discovered:

** Configuration Loading Bugs Fixed
- Missing return statement in ConfigurationAdapter.loadFromFile() caused YAML loading to fail
- No support for -Dbhconfig parameter despite being documented
- System properties configuration worked but YAML file configuration was broken

** Test Coverage Added
- ConfigurationLoadingIntegrationTest: Comprehensive test for YAML and system properties
- BhconfigLoadingTest: Specific test for -Dbhconfig parameter functionality

* Documentation Updates Required

** GETTING_STARTED.md Accuracy
The current GETTING_STARTED.md shows configuration examples that were previously broken. With the configuration loading fixes now implemented, these examples should work correctly:

#+begin_example
# System properties approach (working)
java -javaagent:target/bytehot-latest-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar -Dbytehot.watch.paths=target/classes MyClass

# YAML file approach (now fixed)
java -javaagent:target/bytehot-latest-SNAPSHOT-shaded.jar -Dbhconfig=/path/to/bytehot.yml MyClass
#+end_example

** Sample Configuration Files
Users should have access to working sample configuration files they can copy and modify:

#+begin_src yaml
# Sample bytehot.yml
bytehot:
  watch:
    - path: "target/classes"
      patterns: ["*.class"]
      recursive: true
    - path: "build/classes"
      patterns: ["*.class", "*.jar"]
      recursive: true
#+end_src

* Verification Requirements

** Manual Testing Protocol
1. Follow GETTING_STARTED guide step-by-step
2. Test both configuration approaches with actual Java applications
3. Verify file watching triggers correctly
4. Confirm hot-swap functionality works end-to-end

** Automated Testing
- All configuration tests must pass: mvn test -Dtest="*Config*"
- Integration tests verify YAML and system properties work correctly
- End-to-end tests confirm complete workflow functions

* Implementation Status

✅ Fixed ConfigurationAdapter bugs (missing return, bhconfig support)
✅ Added comprehensive test coverage
✅ Verified configuration loading works correctly
⏳ Update documentation with accurate examples
⏳ Create sample configuration files for users
⏳ Verify end-to-end workflow documentation

* Next Steps

1. Update GETTING_STARTED.md with accurate configuration examples
2. Create sample configuration files in resources/examples/
3. Add troubleshooting section for common configuration issues
4. Document the configuration priority order (system props > env vars > bhconfig > classpath)
