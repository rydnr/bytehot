# ByteHot MVP Specifications

This directory contains detailed specifications for each milestone in the ByteHot Minimum Viable Product (MVP) development roadmap.

## Overview

ByteHot is a JVM agent that enables bytecode hot-swapping at runtime, allowing developers to update method implementations without restarting the application. The MVP focuses on the core workflow: **"update a method, recompile the class, hot-swap the method"**.

## MVP Goal

**Primary Objective:** Enable developers to modify a method implementation, recompile the class, and have ByteHot automatically detect the change and hot-swap the method in the running JVM without restart.

**Key Value Proposition:** Dramatically reduce development feedback loops by eliminating application restarts for method body changes.

## Domain Events Architecture

The ByteHot MVP is built around 10 core domain events that represent the complete hot-swap workflow:

### File System Events (Milestone 1)
- **ClassFileChanged** - When a .class file is modified on disk
- **ClassFileCreated** - When a new .class file appears  
- **ClassFileDeleted** - When a .class file is removed

### Bytecode Analysis Events (Milestone 2)
- **ClassMetadataExtracted** - When class information is successfully parsed
- **BytecodeValidated** - When bytecode passes hot-swap compatibility checks
- **BytecodeRejected** - When bytecode fails validation (incompatible changes)

### Hot-Swap Operation Events (Milestone 3)
- **HotSwapRequested** - When a hot-swap operation is initiated
- **ClassRedefinitionSucceeded** - When JVM successfully redefines a class
- **ClassRedefinitionFailed** - When JVM rejects the class redefinition

### Instance Management Events (Milestone 4)
- **InstancesUpdated** - When existing instances are updated with new behavior

## Technical Architecture

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
ByteHot follows strict DDD principles with clear layer separation:

```
Domain Layer (Essential Complexity)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Aggregates: ByteHot
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Events: 10 core domain events
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Value Objects: File paths, class names, timestamps
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Ports: Interfaces for external communication

Application Layer (Orchestration)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ByteHotApplication: Event routing and coordination
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Event handling and flow control

Infrastructure Layer (Accidental Complexity)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ File system monitoring (ClassFileWatcher)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Bytecode analysis (BytecodeAnalyzer, BytecodeValidator)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ JVM integration (HotSwapManager, InstrumentationProvider)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Framework adapters (Spring, CDI integration)
```

### Event-Driven Architecture
The entire system is built around domain events that flow through the hot-swap pipeline:

```
File Change ‚Üí ClassFileChanged ‚Üí ClassMetadataExtracted ‚Üí BytecodeValidated ‚Üí HotSwapRequested ‚Üí ClassRedefinitionSucceeded ‚Üí InstancesUpdated
```

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
All development follows strict TDD methodology with emoji-based commit conventions:

- üß™ `:test-tube:` - New failing test
- ü§î `:thinking-face:` - Naive implementation  
- ‚úÖ `:white-check-mark:` - Working implementation
- üöÄ `:rocket:` - Refactoring

## Current Progress

### ‚úÖ Completed Milestones (40% of MVP)
- **Milestone 1:** File System Monitoring - 6/6 tests passing
- **Milestone 2:** Bytecode Analysis - 6/6 tests passing

### üöß In Progress
- **Milestone 3:** Hot-Swap Operations - Currently implementing HotSwapRequested event

### üìã Remaining Work
- Complete Milestone 3: Hot-Swap Operations
- Implement Milestone 4: Instance Management  
- Execute Milestone 5: Integration & Testing

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. Domain Events as First-Class Citizens
Every significant system operation is represented as a domain event, providing:
- **Auditability:** Complete workflow tracing
- **Testability:** Event-driven testing strategies
- **Extensibility:** Easy to add new behaviors by subscribing to events
- **Debugging:** Clear visibility into system operations

### 2. Conservative Validation Strategy
ByteHot takes a conservative approach to hot-swap validation:
- **Method body changes:** ‚úÖ Allowed (safe for JVM redefinition)
- **Schema changes:** ‚ùå Rejected (adding/removing fields, changing signatures)
- **When in doubt:** Reject the change and recommend restart

### 3. Framework Integration Points
Designed for easy integration with popular Java frameworks:
- **Spring Framework:** Bean refresh and context management
- **CDI:** Bean lifecycle integration
- **Custom frameworks:** Extensible adapter pattern

### 4. Production-Ready Architecture
Built with production deployment in mind:
- **JVM Agent deployment:** Standard agent JAR with proper manifest
- **Performance monitoring:** Metrics and health checks
- **Configuration management:** YAML-based configuration
- **Security compliance:** Safe for production environments
