# ByteHot Development Specifications

This directory contains detailed specifications for each milestone in the ByteHot development roadmap, following a **Walking Skeleton** approach with small, incrementally valuable steps.

## Overview

ByteHot is a revolutionary JVM agent that enables **true hot-swapping of bytecode at runtime** with comprehensive EventSourcing, user management, and advanced development tooling. The system is built using Domain-Driven Design (DDD) and Hexagonal Architecture principles.

## Core Vision

**Primary Objective:** Transform Java development by eliminating restarts while providing complete runtime introspection, user-aware analytics, and self-documenting system behavior.

**Key Value Propositions:** 
- **Zero-restart development:** Hot-swap any compatible change instantly
- **Complete auditability:** Every action tracked through EventSourcing
- **User-aware analytics:** Track time saved and development efficiency per user
- **Self-documenting flows:** Automatic discovery of business processes from event chains

## Domain Events Architecture

The ByteHot MVP is built around 10 core domain events that represent the complete hot-swap workflow:

### File System Events (Milestone 1)
- **ClassFileChanged** - When a .class file is modified on disk
- **ClassFileCreated** - When a new .class file appears  
- **ClassFileDeleted** - When a .class file is removed

### Bytecode Analysis Events (Milestone 2)
- **ClassMetadataExtracted** - When class information is successfully parsed
- **BytecodeValidated** - When bytecode passes hot-swap compatibility checks
- **BytecodeRejected** - When bytecode fails validation (incompatible changes)

### Hot-Swap Operation Events (Milestone 3)
- **HotSwapRequested** - When a hot-swap operation is initiated
- **ClassRedefinitionSucceeded** - When JVM successfully redefines a class
- **ClassRedefinitionFailed** - When JVM rejects the class redefinition

### Instance Management Events (Milestone 4)
- **InstancesUpdated** - When existing instances are updated with new behavior

## Technical Architecture

### Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
ByteHot follows strict DDD principles with clear layer separation:

```
Domain Layer (Essential Complexity)
â”œâ”€â”€ Aggregates: ByteHot
â”œâ”€â”€ Events: 10 core domain events
â”œâ”€â”€ Value Objects: File paths, class names, timestamps
â””â”€â”€ Ports: Interfaces for external communication

Application Layer (Orchestration)
â”œâ”€â”€ ByteHotApplication: Event routing and coordination
â””â”€â”€ Event handling and flow control

Infrastructure Layer (Accidental Complexity)
â”œâ”€â”€ File system monitoring (ClassFileWatcher)
â”œâ”€â”€ Bytecode analysis (BytecodeAnalyzer, BytecodeValidator)
â”œâ”€â”€ JVM integration (HotSwapManager, InstrumentationProvider)
â””â”€â”€ Framework adapters (Spring, CDI integration)
```

### Event-Driven Architecture
The entire system is built around domain events that flow through the hot-swap pipeline:

```
File Change â†’ ClassFileChanged â†’ ClassMetadataExtracted â†’ BytecodeValidated â†’ HotSwapRequested â†’ ClassRedefinitionSucceeded â†’ InstancesUpdated
```

### Test-Driven Development (TDD)
All development follows strict TDD methodology with emoji-based commit conventions:

- ðŸ§ª `:test-tube:` - New failing test
- ðŸ¤” `:thinking-face:` - Naive implementation  
- âœ… `:white-check-mark:` - Working implementation
- ðŸš€ `:rocket:` - Refactoring

## Key Design Decisions

### 1. EventSourcing as the Foundation
All system state and behavior is derived from immutable domain events:
- **Complete Audit Trail:** Every action traceable through event history
- **Event-Driven Testing:** Tests use events to build state, test actions, and verify results
- **Bug Reproduction:** Exceptions include event snapshots for complete reproduction
- **Flow Discovery:** Business processes emerge automatically from event patterns
- **Time Travel Debugging:** System state can be reconstructed at any point in time

### 2. Walking Skeleton Development Approach
Small, incrementally valuable steps that build upon each other:
- **Independent Value:** Each milestone provides immediate benefit
- **Incremental Testing:** Every step is fully testable in isolation
- **Reduced Risk:** Small changes minimize the impact of errors
- **Continuous Feedback:** Rapid validation of architectural decisions

### 3. User-Aware Operations
All ByteHot operations are associated with specific users:
- **Automatic Discovery:** Users identified from Git, system, or environment
- **Analytics Foundation:** Track time saved and productivity metrics per user
- **Personalized Experience:** User preferences and configuration
- **Compliance Ready:** Complete audit trails for enterprise requirements

### 4. Event-Driven Testing Revolution
Testing fundamentally transformed to use events:
- **Given:** Build system state from pre-existing events
- **When:** Send the event under test
- **Then:** Verify expected resulting events
- **Bug Reports:** Automatic reproduction scenarios from event history

### 5. Hexagonal Architecture with Dynamic Discovery
Complete separation of concerns with runtime adaptation:
- **Port Interfaces:** Domain layer completely isolated from infrastructure
- **Dynamic Adapters:** Automatic discovery and injection of implementations
- **Plugin System:** Extensible architecture for framework integrations
- **Technology Independence:** Domain logic unaffected by infrastructure changes

### 6. Self-Documenting System Behavior
ByteHot understands and documents its own behavior:
- **Flow Detection:** Automatic discovery of business processes from events
- **Runtime Introspection:** Complete self-awareness of system state
- **Documentation Generation:** Automatic creation of process documentation
- **Behavior Analysis:** Pattern recognition in system operations
