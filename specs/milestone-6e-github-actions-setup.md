## Implementation Details

### Maven Configuration Integration

**Parent POM Compliance:**
- All dependency versions managed in parent POM (`acmsl-pom`)
- Child modules inherit versions without explicit declaration
- Security updates centralized at parent level

**Updated Dependencies:**
```xml
<!-- Security fixes implemented -->
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.mysql</groupId>
  <artifactId>mysql-connector-j</artifactId>
  <version>8.4.0</version>  <!-- Fixed CVE-2023-22102, CVE-2023-21971 -->
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>com.fasterxml.jackson.core</groupId>
  <artifactId>jackson-databind</artifactId>
  <version>2.18.2</version>  <!-- Fixed CVE-2023-35116 -->
</dependency>
```

### Caching Strategy

**Maven Dependencies:**
```yaml
Cache Key: ${{ runner.os }}-maven-${{ hashFiles('**/pom.xml') }}
Cache Paths: ~/.m2/repository
Restore Keys: ${{ runner.os }}-maven-
```

**Performance Benefits:**
- Build time reduction: ~60% for cached builds
- Network usage reduction: Minimal dependency downloads
- Parallel workflow execution: Independent job caching

### Security Implementation

**Secrets Management:**
- `NVD_API_KEY`: Secure API key for vulnerability database access
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Automatic token for releases and pages deployment

**Permission Configuration:**
```yaml
permissions:
  contents: read      # Repository access
  pages: write        # GitHub Pages deployment
  id-token: write     # OIDC token access
```

**Security Scanning:**
- OWASP Dependency Check with NVD API integration
- Automated vulnerability detection and reporting
- Dependency tree analysis for security audit trails
