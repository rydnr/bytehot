#+TITLE: ByteHot Versioning and Release Strategy
#+AUTHOR: Claude Code
#+DATE: 2025-06-21

* Overview

This specification establishes the official versioning and release strategy for ByteHot, aligned with semantic versioning principles and the milestone-based development approach. The strategy ensures consistency, predictability, and automation in version management.

* Semantic Versioning Strategy

ByteHot follows semantic versioning (semver) with milestone-aligned major and minor versions, and CI/CD-managed patch versions.

** Version Format

All ByteHot versions follow the format: =X.Y.Z= (no =v= prefix)

- =X= (Major): Significant architectural phases
- =Y= (Minor): Completed milestones within a phase  
- =Z= (Patch): Bug fixes and hotfixes (CI/CD managed)

** Examples
- =1.2.1=: Core Foundation phase, with Milestones 6A and 6F complete, plus one patch
- =2.0.0=: EventSourcing Complete phase begins
- =2.7.0=: EventSourcing phase with all milestones 6A-6G complete

| =3.0.0= | Advanced Features Complete | Milestones 7-10 | 📋 PLANNED |

* Patch Version Strategy

Patch versions are **automatically managed by CI/CD tools** and increment for:

- Bug fixes and hotfixes
- Configuration corrections  
- Security patches
- Documentation updates
- Test improvements
- Performance optimizations

** Automated Patch Increment Rules

GitHub Actions automatically increments patch versions when:

1. **Bug Fix Commits**: Commits with prefixes =fix:=, =🐛=, =✅= (when fixing issues)
2. **Security Commits**: Commits with prefixes =security:=, =🔒=
3. **Configuration Commits**: Commits with prefixes =config:=, =🔧=
4. **Hotfix Branches**: Any merge from =hotfix/*= branches

** Manual Patch Override

Developers can specify patch versions manually only for:
- Critical production issues requiring immediate release
- Security vulnerabilities requiring coordinated disclosure
- Configuration changes that must be versioned for compliance

* Tag Naming Conventions

** Correct Tag Format
- ✅ =1.2.1= (correct semver format)
- ✅ =2.0.0= (major version release)
- ✅ =1.7.0= (minor version release)

** Incorrect Tag Formats  
- ❌ =v1.2.1= (no =v= prefix allowed)
- ❌ =1.2= (must include patch version)
- ❌ =release-1.2.1= (no prefixes allowed)
- ❌ =1.2.1-beta= (pre-release tags not used in main branch)

** Special Tags

Special tags for development and automation:

- =milestone-6a-complete=: Milestone completion markers (kept for reference)
- =test-*=: Testing and CI/CD validation tags
- =docs-*=: Documentation milestone tags

* Current Version Status Analysis

** Correction Required: v0.7.1 → 1.2.1

The recently created =v0.7.1= tag is incorrect and needs correction:

*** Why v0.7.1 is Wrong
1. **v prefix violation**: Should not include =v= prefix
2. **Phase misalignment**: Should be in 1.x.x phase (Core Foundation Complete)
3. **Milestone miscount**: Doesn't reflect actual milestone completion status

*** Correct Version: 1.2.1
1. **Major 1**: Core Foundation Complete phase
2. **Minor 2**: Core Foundation + Milestone 6A (EventSourcing) + Milestone 6F (Flow Detection)  
3. **Patch 1**: Configuration loading bug fix

*** Historical Alignment
Retrospective milestone-to-version mapping:
- =1.0.0=: Core Foundation complete (Milestones 1-5)
- =1.1.0=: + Milestone 6A (Basic EventSourcing Infrastructure)  
- =1.2.0=: + Milestone 6F (Flow Detection)
- =1.2.1=: + Configuration loading fix

* Release Automation Strategy

** GitHub Actions Integration

The release process is fully automated through GitHub Actions:

*** Tag-Triggered Releases
1. **Tag Creation**: Developer creates proper semver tag
2. **Workflow Detection**: GitHub Actions detects new tag
3. **Artifact Building**: Automated JAR compilation and packaging  
4. **Changelog Generation**: Intelligent commit analysis and categorization
5. **GitHub Release**: Automated release creation with artifacts

*** Patch Version Automation
1. **Commit Analysis**: GitHub Actions analyzes commit messages
2. **Automatic Tagging**: Creates patch version tags for qualifying commits
3. **Release Creation**: Automated release for patch versions
4. **Notification**: Team notification of automated releases

** Release Artifact Strategy

Each release includes standardized artifacts:

*** Required Artifacts
- =bytehot-X.Y.Z-agent.jar=: JVM agent for production use
- =bytehot-X.Y.Z.jar=: Library JAR for integration
- =bytehot-X.Y.Z-sources.jar=: Source code archive
- =bytehot-X.Y.Z-javadoc.jar=: API documentation

*** Optional Artifacts  
- =bytehot-X.Y.Z-docs.zip=: Complete documentation bundle
- =bytehot-X.Y.Z-examples.zip=: Usage examples and tutorials

** Changelog Generation Strategy

Automated changelog generation categorizes commits:

*** Commit Categories
- **🎯 New Features**: Major functionality additions (minor version worthy)
- **🔧 Bug Fixes**: Issue resolutions and corrections  
- **🚀 Performance**: Optimization and efficiency improvements
- **📚 Documentation**: Documentation updates and improvements

* Migration Strategy

** Immediate Actions Required

1. **Delete Incorrect Tag**: Remove =v0.7.1= tag and associated GitHub release
2. **Create Correct Tag**: Create =1.2.1= tag for configuration fix
3. **Update Documentation**: Update all references to use correct versioning
4. **Configure CI/CD**: Update GitHub Actions for proper semver handling

** Implementation Steps

*** Step 1: Tag Correction
#+begin_src bash
* Delete incorrect tag locally and remotely
git tag -d v0.7.1
git push origin --delete v0.7.1

* Create correct tag
git tag -a 1.2.1 -s -m "ByteHot 1.2.1 - Configuration Loading Fix"
git push origin 1.2.1
#+end_src

*** Step 2: GitHub Actions Update
- Update release workflows to validate semver format
- Add automatic patch version detection
- Configure milestone-to-version mapping

*** Step 3: Documentation Update
- Update all version references in documentation
- Add versioning strategy to GETTING_STARTED guide
- Update contributor guidelines

* Compliance and Governance

** Semver Compliance

ByteHot strictly follows semantic versioning principles:

- **Backward Compatibility**: Patch and minor versions maintain backward compatibility
- **Breaking Changes**: Only allowed in major version changes
- **API Stability**: Public APIs remain stable within major versions
- **Deprecation Process**: Features deprecated in minor versions, removed in major versions

** Release Approval Process

*** Automated Releases (Patch Versions)
- No approval required for qualifying patch commits
- Automated testing must pass
- Security scans must complete successfully

*** Manual Releases (Minor/Major Versions)  
- Milestone completion verification required
- Full test suite must pass (unit, integration, performance)
- Documentation completeness verification
- Security vulnerability scan clearance

** Quality Gates

Each release must pass quality gates:

*** Code Quality
- ✅ All tests passing (unit, integration, performance)
- ✅ Code coverage > 80%  
- ✅ No critical security vulnerabilities
- ✅ No major code quality issues (SonarQube/similar)

*** Documentation Quality
- ✅ API documentation complete and accurate
- ✅ User guides updated for new features
- ✅ Migration guides for breaking changes
- ✅ Changelog properly generated

- ✅ Memory overhead < 10MB
- ✅ CPU overhead < 2%
- ✅ Success rate > 99% for compatible changes

* Future Considerations

** Long-term Versioning Strategy

*** Enterprise Versioning (4.x.x+)
Future enterprise versions may require:
- Long-term support (LTS) versioning
- Extended security patching  
- Enterprise compliance versioning
- Multi-environment deployment versioning

*** Plugin Ecosystem Versioning
Plugin architecture will require:
- Plugin API versioning
- Plugin compatibility matrices
- Independent plugin versioning
- Cross-plugin dependency management

** Version Communication Strategy

*** Public Communication
- GitHub releases with comprehensive changelogs
- Documentation site version indicators
- API documentation versioning
- Community announcement coordination

*** Developer Communication  
- Version-specific development guides
- Migration path documentation
- Breaking change notifications
- Deprecation timelines
