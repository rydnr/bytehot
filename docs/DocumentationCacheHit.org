* DocumentationCacheHit Class

** Overview

=DocumentationCacheHit= is a domain event that represents when documentation URL is successfully retrieved from cache. It tracks cache performance and effectiveness to enable optimization of the documentation caching system.

** Package Structure

#+begin_src java
package org.acmsl.bytehot.domain.events;
#+end_src

** Class Hierarchy

- Extends: =AbstractVersionedDomainEvent=
- Implements: =DomainResponseEvent<DocumentationRequested>=

** Responsibilities

- Represent when documentation URL is retrieved from cache
- Track cache performance and effectiveness
- Enable cache optimization and analytics
- Provide response correlation to original documentation requests

** Key Attributes

*** Request Correlation
- =originalRequest=: The original =DocumentationRequested= event
- =cacheKey=: Cache key used for the lookup

*** Cache Performance Data
- =cachedUrl=: The cached URL that was retrieved
- =originalStrategy=: Strategy used to generate the originally cached entry
- =cacheAge=: Age of the cached entry
- =retrievalTime=: Time taken to retrieve from cache
- =hitAt=: Timestamp when the cache hit occurred

** Factory Methods

*** forSuccessfulRetrieval
Creates a new cache hit event for successful cache retrieval:

#+begin_src java
public static DocumentationCacheHit forSuccessfulRetrieval(
    final DocumentationRequested originalRequest,
    final String cachedUrl,
    final DocumentationGenerationStrategy originalStrategy,
    final Duration cacheAge,
    final Duration retrievalTime,
    final String cacheKey
)
#+end_src

Creates correlated metadata linking to the original request.

** Performance Assessment Methods

*** isFreshCacheEntry
Returns =true= if cache age is less than 1 hour.

*** isFastRetrieval
Returns =true= if retrieval time was less than 1ms.

*** getCacheEffectiveness
Returns effectiveness category based on freshness and speed:
- =EXCELLENT=: Fast retrieval AND fresh entry
- =GOOD=: Fast retrieval OR fresh entry
- =FAIR=: Entry less than 1 day old
- =POOR=: Entry older than 1 day

** Response Event Pattern

*** getPreceding
Implements =DomainResponseEvent= interface to provide correlation to the original =DocumentationRequested= event.

** Usage Patterns

*** Cache Performance Monitoring
Used by caching systems to track hit rates and effectiveness.

*** Cache Optimization
Provides data for optimizing cache strategies and TTL settings.

*** Analytics Integration
Feeds into documentation analytics for system performance insights.

** Integration Points

*** Event Sourcing
- Part of the event sourcing architecture
- Correlated with original documentation requests
- Contributes to cache analytics aggregation

*** Cache Management
- Triggered by cache retrieval operations
- Provides feedback for cache optimization
- Supports cache warming strategies

** Design Considerations

*** Correlation Tracking
Maintains correlation to original request through =DomainResponseEvent= pattern.

*** Performance Metrics
Captures both temporal (age) and performance (retrieval time) metrics.

*** Effectiveness Scoring
Provides simple effectiveness categorization for monitoring and alerting.

** Dependencies

- =AbstractVersionedDomainEvent=: Base event sourcing functionality
- =DomainResponseEvent=: Response correlation pattern
- =DocumentationRequested=: Original request event
- =DocumentationGenerationStrategy=: Strategy enum
- =EventMetadata=: Event metadata support
- =Duration=, =Instant=: Time-based metrics
- Lombok annotations for code generation

** Testing Considerations

- Test factory method with various cache scenarios
- Verify correlation with original request
- Test effectiveness categorization logic
- Validate performance threshold calculations
- Test boundary conditions for age and retrieval time
