* DocumentationCacheMiss Class

** Overview

=DocumentationCacheMiss= is a domain event that represents when documentation URL is not found in cache. It triggers fallback documentation generation and helps track cache effectiveness patterns for optimization.

** Package Structure

#+begin_src java
package org.acmsl.bytehot.domain.events;
#+end_src

** Class Hierarchy

- Extends: =AbstractVersionedDomainEvent=
- Implements: =DomainResponseEvent<DocumentationRequested>=

** Responsibilities

- Represent when documentation URL is not found in cache
- Track cache miss patterns for optimization
- Trigger fallback documentation generation
- Provide response correlation to original documentation requests

** Key Attributes

*** Request Correlation
- =originalRequest=: The original =DocumentationRequested= event
- =missedCacheKey=: Cache key that was looked up but not found

*** Miss Analysis Data
- =lookupTime=: Time taken to perform the cache lookup
- =missReason=: Reason for the cache miss (NOT_FOUND, EXPIRED, INVALID)
- =isFirstMiss=: Whether this is the first miss for this key
- =missedAt=: Timestamp when the cache miss occurred

** Factory Methods

*** forKeyNotFound
Creates a new cache miss event for unsuccessful cache lookup:

#+begin_src java
public static DocumentationCacheMiss forKeyNotFound(
    final DocumentationRequested originalRequest,
    final String missedCacheKey,
    final Duration lookupTime,
    final String missReason,
    final boolean isFirstMiss
)
#+end_src

Creates correlated metadata linking to the original request.

** Analysis Methods

*** indicatesOptimizationOpportunity
Returns =true= if this is a repeated miss for the same key, indicating potential cache optimization opportunities.

*** isFastLookup
Returns =true= if lookup time was less than 5ms.

*** getMissSeverity
Returns severity level based on frequency and lookup performance:
- =LOW=: First miss AND fast lookup
- =MEDIUM=: First miss OR fast lookup  
- =HIGH=: Repeated miss AND slow lookup (not both conditions met)
- =CRITICAL=: Repeated miss AND slow lookup

** Response Event Pattern

*** getPreceding
Implements =DomainResponseEvent= interface to provide correlation to the original =DocumentationRequested= event.

** Usage Patterns

*** Cache Optimization
Used to identify patterns in cache misses and optimization opportunities.

*** Fallback Triggering
Signals the need for fresh documentation generation when cache fails.

*** Performance Monitoring
Tracks cache lookup performance and miss frequency.

** Integration Points

*** Event Sourcing
- Part of the event sourcing architecture
- Correlated with original documentation requests
- Contributes to cache analytics aggregation

*** Cache Management
- Triggered by failed cache lookups
- Provides data for cache warming strategies
- Supports cache eviction policy optimization

*** Documentation Generation
- Triggers fallback documentation generation
- Provides context for generation prioritization

** Design Considerations

*** Miss Reason Tracking
Captures specific reasons for cache misses to enable targeted optimization.

*** Frequency Analysis
Tracks whether this is a first or repeated miss to identify problematic patterns.

*** Performance Impact
Measures lookup time to assess cache infrastructure performance.

** Dependencies

- =AbstractVersionedDomainEvent=: Base event sourcing functionality
- =DomainResponseEvent=: Response correlation pattern
- =DocumentationRequested=: Original request event
- =EventMetadata=: Event metadata support
- =Duration=, =Instant=: Time-based metrics
- Lombok annotations for code generation

** Testing Considerations

- Test factory method with various miss scenarios
- Verify correlation with original request
- Test severity calculation logic with different combinations
- Validate optimization opportunity detection
- Test boundary conditions for lookup time thresholds
