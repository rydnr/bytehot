#+DATE: [2025-06-20]

* Overview

The ~EventEmitterPort~ interface serves as ByteHot's sophisticated domain event publishing abstraction, defining a comprehensive contract for emitting domain response events to external systems, monitoring infrastructure, and integration endpoints. This critical secondary port abstracts event emission implementation details from domain logic, enabling flexible publishing strategies including logging, messaging, streaming, and database persistence while maintaining consistency and reliability across diverse deployment scenarios. As the cornerstone of ByteHot's event-driven integration architecture, it provides the foundation for real-time monitoring, analytics, external system coordination, and comprehensive observability throughout the intelligent hot-swap system lifecycle.

- Enables multiple emission strategies including logging, messaging, streaming, and persistence
- Provides clean separation between event generation and external system integration
- Acts as the domain's gateway to external monitoring, analytics, and integration systems

** Event-Driven Architecture Foundation
The port provides comprehensive event-driven architecture foundation:
- Supports real-time event streaming for immediate system responsiveness
- Enables batch event processing for efficient resource utilization and performance
- Provides event emission health monitoring for system reliability and observability
- Supports sophisticated event correlation and tracing across distributed systems

** Integration and Observability Gateway
The implementation serves as the gateway for system integration and observability:
- Enables real-time monitoring and alerting through event emission to monitoring systems
