* DocumentationAnalyticsEvent Class

** Overview

=DocumentationAnalyticsEvent= is a domain event that represents aggregated documentation system analytics. It provides insights into documentation system performance and usage patterns.

** Package Structure

#+begin_src java
package org.acmsl.bytehot.domain.events;
#+end_src

** Class Hierarchy

- Extends: =AbstractVersionedDomainEvent=
- Implements: EventSourcing patterns through base class

** Responsibilities

- Represent aggregated documentation system analytics
- Track patterns and trends in documentation usage  
- Enable data-driven documentation system optimization
- Provide system health monitoring capabilities

** Key Attributes

*** Core Metrics
- =reportingPeriod=: Time period covered by the analytics report
- =totalRequests=: Total number of documentation requests processed
- =compiledAt=: Timestamp when analytics were compiled

*** Performance Metrics
- =cacheHitRate=: Cache hit rate (0.0 to 1.0)
- =averageGenerationTime=: Average documentation generation time
- =flowDetectionSuccessRate=: Flow detection success rate (0.0 to 1.0)

*** Distribution Data
- =documentationTypeDistribution=: Distribution of documentation types requested
- =strategyDistribution=: Distribution of generation strategies used
- =topRequestedClasses=: Top requested classes for documentation
- =performanceMetrics=: Performance metrics by category

*** Analysis Data
- =crossReferencesDiscovered=: Number of cross-references discovered

** Factory Methods

*** forPeriodicReport
Creates a new analytics event for periodic reporting:

#+begin_src java
public static DocumentationAnalyticsEvent forPeriodicReport(
    final Duration reportingPeriod,
    final long totalRequests,
    final double cacheHitRate,
    final Duration averageGenerationTime,
    final double flowDetectionSuccessRate,
    final Map<String, Long> documentationTypeDistribution,
    final Map<String, Long> strategyDistribution,
    final Map<String, Long> topRequestedClasses,
    final Map<String, Double> performanceMetrics,
    final long crossReferencesDiscovered
)
#+end_src

** Health Assessment Methods

*** isExcellentCachePerformance
Returns =true= if cache hit rate is >= 0.9.

*** isFlowDetectionPerformingWell  
Returns =true= if flow detection success rate is >= 0.8.

*** isFastGenerationPerformance
Returns =true= if average generation time is less than 50ms.

*** getSystemHealthScore
Calculates overall system health score (0.0 to 1.0) based on:
- Cache performance
- Flow detection success
- Generation speed

*** getSystemHealthCategory
Returns health category: EXCELLENT, GOOD, FAIR, or POOR.

*** isHighDocumentationActivity
Returns =true= if requests per hour exceed 100.

** Usage Patterns

*** Periodic Analytics Reporting
Used by documentation analytics services to aggregate and report system performance metrics.

*** System Health Monitoring
Provides continuous monitoring of documentation system health and performance.

*** Performance Optimization
Enables data-driven optimization decisions based on usage patterns and performance metrics.

** Integration Points

*** Event Sourcing
- Part of the event sourcing architecture
- Stored with full metadata for historical analysis
- Enables trend analysis over time

*** Monitoring Systems
- Can be consumed by monitoring and alerting systems
- Provides metrics for dashboard visualization
- Supports automated health checks

** Design Considerations

*** Immutability
All fields are final and collections are defensively copied to ensure immutability.

*** Comprehensive Metrics
Covers all aspects of documentation system performance for complete visibility.

*** Health Scoring
Provides simple health scoring to enable quick system assessment.

** Dependencies

- =AbstractVersionedDomainEvent=: Base event sourcing functionality
- =EventMetadata=: Event metadata support
- =Duration=, =Instant=: Time-based metrics
- =Map=: Distribution and metrics storage
- Lombok annotations for code generation

** Testing Considerations

- Test factory method with various metric combinations
- Verify health scoring calculations
- Test boundary conditions for performance thresholds
- Validate immutability of collections
