* DocumentationCrossReferenceDiscovered Class

** Overview

=DocumentationCrossReferenceDiscovered= is a domain event that represents when relationships between documentation artifacts are discovered. It enables building a rich knowledge graph of documentation relationships and supports enhanced contextual documentation generation.

** Package Structure

#+begin_src java
package org.acmsl.bytehot.domain.events;
#+end_src

** Class Hierarchy

- Extends: =AbstractVersionedDomainEvent=
- Implements: =DomainResponseEvent<DocumentationRequested>=

** Responsibilities

- Represent when relationships between documentation artifacts are found
- Track cross-reference discovery for documentation analytics
- Enable enhanced contextual documentation generation
- Build knowledge graphs of documentation relationships

** Key Attributes

*** Request Correlation
- =originalRequest=: The original =DocumentationRequested= event that triggered analysis
- =sourceArtifact=: The source documentation artifact

*** Relationship Data
- =relatedArtifacts=: List of related documentation artifacts discovered
- =relationshipType=: Type of relationship (INHERITANCE, COMPOSITION, USAGE, REFERENCE, FLOW_SEQUENCE)
- =relationshipStrength=: Strength of the relationship (0.0 to 1.0)

*** Discovery Metadata
- =discoveryContext=: Optional context in which the relationship was discovered
- =discoveryMethod=: Method or approach used to discover the relationship
- =relationshipMetadata=: Optional additional metadata about the relationship
- =discoveredAt=: Timestamp when the cross-reference was discovered

** Factory Methods

*** forBasicDiscovery
Creates a basic cross-reference discovery event:

#+begin_src java
public static DocumentationCrossReferenceDiscovered forBasicDiscovery(
    final DocumentationRequested originalRequest,
    final String sourceArtifact,
    final List<String> relatedArtifacts,
    final String relationshipType,
    final double relationshipStrength,
    final String discoveryMethod
)
#+end_src

*** forContextualDiscovery
Creates a contextual cross-reference discovery event with additional context and metadata:

#+begin_src java
public static DocumentationCrossReferenceDiscovered forContextualDiscovery(
    final DocumentationRequested originalRequest,
    final String sourceArtifact,
    final List<String> relatedArtifacts,
    final String relationshipType,
    final double relationshipStrength,
    final String discoveryContext,
    final String discoveryMethod,
    final String relationshipMetadata
)
#+end_src

** Relationship Analysis Methods

*** isStrongRelationship
Returns =true= if relationship strength is >= 0.7.

*** hasMultipleRelations
Returns =true= if more than one related artifact was found.

*** getRelationshipQuality
Returns quality category based on relationship strength:
- =EXCELLENT=: Strength >= 0.9
- =GOOD=: Strength >= 0.7
- =FAIR=: Strength >= 0.5
- =WEAK=: Strength < 0.5

*** enhancesContextualDocumentation
Returns =true= if discovery has context and strong relationships, indicating high value for documentation enhancement.

** Response Event Pattern

*** getPreceding
Implements =DomainResponseEvent= interface to provide correlation to the original =DocumentationRequested= event.

** Usage Patterns

*** Knowledge Graph Building
Used to build relationships between documentation artifacts for enhanced navigation and context.

*** Contextual Documentation
Enables generation of richer documentation by including related artifacts and their relationships.

*** Documentation Analytics
Provides data for analyzing documentation coverage and relationship patterns.

** Relationship Types

*** INHERITANCE
Object-oriented inheritance relationships between classes.

*** COMPOSITION
Composition relationships where one class contains another.

*** USAGE
Usage relationships where one class uses services of another.

*** REFERENCE
Reference relationships in documentation or code comments.

*** FLOW_SEQUENCE
Sequential relationships in business flows or processes.

** Integration Points

*** Event Sourcing
- Part of the event sourcing architecture
- Correlated with original documentation requests
- Contributes to knowledge graph analytics

*** Documentation Generation
- Enhances documentation with cross-references
- Provides context for link generation
- Supports navigation improvement

*** Knowledge Management
- Builds documentation knowledge graphs
- Supports intelligent documentation search
- Enables recommendation systems

** Design Considerations

*** Strength Scoring
Uses numerical strength scoring (0.0-1.0) to quantify relationship importance.

*** Optional Context
Supports both basic and contextual discovery patterns through optional fields.

*** Immutability
All collections are defensively copied to ensure event immutability.

** Dependencies

- =AbstractVersionedDomainEvent=: Base event sourcing functionality
- =DomainResponseEvent=: Response correlation pattern
- =DocumentationRequested=: Original request event
- =EventMetadata=: Event metadata support
- =Instant=: Timestamp support
- =List=, =Optional=: Collection and optional support
- Lombok annotations for code generation

** Testing Considerations

- Test both factory methods with various relationship scenarios
- Verify correlation with original request
- Test relationship quality categorization
- Validate strength scoring edge cases
- Test immutability of collections
- Verify contextual enhancement detection logic
