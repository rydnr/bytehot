* Processing Status Analysis and Business Logic

** Success vs. Failure Processing Patterns
The ProcessingResult enumeration enables sophisticated processing analysis:
- **SUCCESS**: File was successfully processed, validated, and potentially triggered hot-swap operations

- **DEFERRED**: Processing was postponed due to resource constraints or dependencies

** Processing Performance Analytics
The event enables comprehensive performance analysis:
- **Processing Latency**: Time difference between file change detection and processing completion
- **Success Rate Analysis**: Statistical analysis of processing success vs. failure rates
- **Processing Throughput**: Analysis of file processing throughput and capacity
