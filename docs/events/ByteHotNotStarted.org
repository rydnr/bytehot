#+TITLE: ByteHotNotStarted - ByteHot Agent Attach Failure Event
#+AUTHOR: ByteHot Development Team
#+DATE: [2025-06-20]

* Overview

The ~ByteHotNotStarted~ event represents a failed attempt to attach the ByteHot agent to the JVM, providing comprehensive failure context and error information for precise failure analysis and automated recovery coordination.

* Event Structure and Failure Context

** Core Failure Information and Error Context
#+BEGIN_SRC java :tangle ../../bytehot/src/main/java/org/acmsl/bytehot/domain/events/ByteHotNotStarted.java
/**
 * The original event that requested the agent attachment
 * @return the preceding ByteHotAttachRequested event
 */
@Getter
private final ByteHotAttachRequested preceding;

/**
 * The error cause that prevented the agent from starting
 * @return the throwable that caused the failure
 */
@Getter
private final Throwable errorCause;
#+END_SRC

* Domain Response Event Role

This event serves as a DomainResponseEvent that responds to ByteHotAttachRequested with failure information, enabling the system to handle agent attachment failures gracefully and provide meaningful error reporting.

- [[ByteHotAttachRequested.org][ByteHotAttachRequested]]: The original event that this responds to
- [[ByteHotAgentAttached.org][ByteHotAgentAttached]]: The successful counterpart event
- [[../ByteHot.org][ByteHot]]: The domain aggregate that processes this event

* Implementation Notes

The event implements the DomainResponseEvent pattern, providing causal relationship tracking between the original request and the failure response, enabling comprehensive error analysis and system recovery.

The ByteHotNotStarted event provides ByteHot's essential agent attachment failure foundation while maintaining comprehensive error context and causal relationship tracking.
