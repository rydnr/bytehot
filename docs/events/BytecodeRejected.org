#+TITLE: BytecodeRejected - Validation Failure Detection and Safety Gate Event
#+AUTHOR: ByteHot Development Team
#+DATE: [2025-06-20]

* Overview

The ~BytecodeRejected~ event serves as ByteHot's critical safety gate and validation failure detection signal for bytecode that fails compatibility checks, representing the authoritative rejection of unsafe or incompatible bytecode changes that could compromise system stability. This essential domain event provides comprehensive rejection context including validation failure details, safety concerns, and remediation guidance that enables intelligent error handling and developer feedback. As the safety guardian in ByteHot's validation pipeline, it prevents unsafe hot-swap operations while maintaining complete audit trails and supporting sophisticated debugging assistance, quality assurance, and continuous improvement throughout the entire intelligent hot-swap system lifecycle.
