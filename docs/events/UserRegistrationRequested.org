#+TITLE: UserRegistrationRequested - User Registration Request and Workflow Initiation Event
#+AUTHOR: ByteHot Development Team
#+DATE: [2025-06-20]

* Overview

The ~UserRegistrationRequested~ event represents a user registration request, providing comprehensive registration context and workflow initiation for precise user management and automated registration coordination.

* Event Structure and Registration Context

** Core User and Registration Information
#+BEGIN_SRC java :tangle ../../bytehot/src/main/java/org/acmsl/bytehot/domain/events/UserRegistrationRequested.java
/**
 * User identifier to register for user management coordination
 * @return the UserId for the registration request
 */
private final UserId userId;

/**
 * Registration source indicating how the registration was initiated
 * @return the source of the registration request
 */
private final UserRegistered.UserRegistrationSource source;
#+END_SRC

* Domain Event Role

This event serves as a DomainEvent that initiates the user registration workflow, triggering the necessary processes to register a new user in the ByteHot system with appropriate source tracking and context management.

* User Registration Workflow Initiation

The event enables comprehensive user registration coordination:
- **User Identification**: Clear user identification through UserId for registration tracking
- **Source Tracking**: Registration source tracking for audit and workflow optimization
- **Workflow Triggering**: Initiation of user registration processes and coordination
- **Context Management**: Registration context preservation for comprehensive user management

- [[UserAuthenticated.org][UserAuthenticated]]: Follow-up authentication events
- [[../UserId.org][UserId]]: User identifier used in registration
- [[../User.org][User]]: User aggregate that processes registration requests

* Implementation Notes

** Design Patterns Applied
The event leverages several sophisticated design patterns:
- **Domain Event Pattern**: Registration workflow initiation through event-driven architecture
- **Request-Response Pattern**: Registration request that leads to response events
- **Source Tracking Pattern**: Registration source tracking for audit and optimization

** Domain-Driven Design Principles
The implementation follows strict DDD principles:
- **Rich Events**: Comprehensive registration context beyond simple notification
- **Domain Intelligence**: Built-in intelligence for registration source management
- **Workflow Coordination**: Clear workflow initiation through domain events

The UserRegistrationRequested event provides ByteHot's essential user registration foundation while maintaining comprehensive registration context and workflow coordination for advanced user management scenarios.
