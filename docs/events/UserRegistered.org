#+TITLE: UserRegistered - User Registration Success and Profile Creation Event
#+AUTHOR: ByteHot Development Team
#+DATE: [2025-06-20]

* Overview

The ~UserRegistered~ event represents successful user registration, providing comprehensive user profile information and registration source tracking for precise user management and automated profile coordination.

* Event Structure and Registration Success Context

** Core Registration Success and Profile Information

** Registration Source Classification and Intelligence
#+BEGIN_SRC java :tangle ../../bytehot/src/main/java/org/acmsl/bytehot/domain/events/UserRegistered.java
/**
 * User registration source enumeration for comprehensive source tracking
 */
public enum UserRegistrationSource {
    /**
     * User automatically discovered and registered through auto-discovery
     */
    AUTOMATIC,

    /**
     * User explicitly registered through manual intervention
     */
    EXPLICIT,

    /**
     * User registered from Git configuration through Git integration
     */

* Domain Response Event Role

This event serves as a DomainResponseEvent that responds to UserRegistrationRequested with successful registration completion, providing the system with confirmed user registration and profile information for subsequent user operations.

* User Registration Intelligence and Workflow Completion

The event provides comprehensive registration completion intelligence:
- **Profile Management**: Complete user profile creation and management through UserProfile integration
- **Source Tracking**: Comprehensive registration source tracking for audit and optimization
- **Causal Relationships**: Clear causal tracking from registration request to completion
- **Workflow Completion**: Registration workflow completion with success confirmation

- [[UserAuthenticationRequested.org][UserAuthenticationRequested]]: Follow-up authentication workflow events
- [[../UserProfile.org][UserProfile]]: User profile information encapsulated in this event
- [[../User.org][User]]: User aggregate that processes registration events

* Implementation Notes

** Design Patterns Applied
The event leverages several sophisticated design patterns:
- **Domain Response Event Pattern**: Registration completion response with comprehensive context
- **Factory Method Pattern**: Streamlined event creation through static factory methods
- **Enumeration Pattern**: Registration source classification and tracking

** Domain-Driven Design Principles
The implementation follows strict DDD principles:
- **Rich Events**: Comprehensive registration context beyond simple notification
- **Domain Intelligence**: Built-in intelligence for registration source management and profile tracking
- **Causal Relationships**: Clear causal tracking from request to successful completion

The UserRegistered event provides ByteHot's essential user registration completion foundation while maintaining comprehensive profile management and source tracking for advanced user management scenarios.
