* ByteHot Implementation

🔥 *Revolutionary Literate Programming Documentation* 🔥

This section contains comprehensive literate programming documentation for all ByteHot components, following Domain-Driven Design principles and hexagonal architecture patterns.

** 🏗️ Core Architecture

*** Domain Layer
**** [[file:docs/ByteHot.html][🎯 ByteHot Aggregate]]
Central domain aggregate coordinating hot-swap operations and system state.

**** [[file:docs/HotSwapManager.html][🔄 Hot-Swap Manager]]
Core domain service managing the complete hot-swap lifecycle.

**** [[file:docs/BytecodeValidator.html][✅ Bytecode Validator]]
Domain service ensuring bytecode compatibility and validation.

**** [[file:docs/FrameworkIntegration.html][🔗 Framework Integration]]
Integration patterns for external frameworks and libraries.

** 🔌 Domain Services & Adapters

*** [[file:docs/InstrumentationService.html][🔧 Instrumentation Service]]
Core domain service providing JVM instrumentation capabilities and class redefinition operations.

*** [[file:docs/ports/FileWatcherPort.html][👁️ File Watcher Port]]
Domain interface for file system monitoring operations.

*** [[file:docs/FileWatcherAdapter.html][📁 File Watcher Adapter]]
Infrastructure implementation of file system monitoring capabilities.

*** [[file:docs/ConfigurationPort.html][⚙️ Configuration Port]]

** 🎭 Domain Events

*** [[file:docs/events/ClassFileChanged.html][📝 Class File Changed]]
Event triggered when a class file is modified on disk.

*** [[file:docs/events/HotSwapRequested.html][🔄 Hot-Swap Requested]]
Event triggered when a hot-swap operation is initiated.

*** [[file:docs/events/UserSessionStarted.html][👤 User Session Started]]
Event triggered when a user session is established.

** 📊 Advanced Components

*** [[file:docs/RollbackManager.html][↩️ Rollback Management]]
Sophisticated rollback and recovery coordination system.

*** [[file:docs/StatePreserver.html][💾 State Preservation]]
Object state preservation and restoration during redefinitions.

*** [[file:docs/ErrorRecoveryManager.html][🚑 Error Recovery]]
Automated error recovery and system resilience management.

*** [[file:docs/Flow.html][🌊 Flow Detection]]
Dynamic process flow discovery and documentation system.

** 🎨 Revolutionary Architecture

ByteHot's literate programming approach combines Domain-Driven Design with hexagonal architecture, creating a self-documenting system where code and documentation evolve together in perfect harmony.

** 📖 Documentation Principles

All implementation documentation follows strict literate programming principles:

- **Invariant Documentation:** Each class documents its assumptions and guarantees
- **Behavior Documentation:** Complete explanation of class responsibilities and collaborations  
- **Architecture Compliance:** Strict adherence to hexagonal architecture boundaries
- **Code Tangling:** Documentation fragments that generate actual implementation
- **Living Documentation:** Documentation that evolves with the codebase
