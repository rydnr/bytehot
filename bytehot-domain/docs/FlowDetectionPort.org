The ~FlowDetectionPort~ interface serves as ByteHot's critical secondary port for flow detection and persistence operations within the Domain-Driven Design architecture. This infrastructure boundary defines the contract for analyzing event sequences to discover patterns, storing discovered flows for future reference, and managing the complete lifecycle of flow knowledge within the ByteHot ecosystem. As a cornerstone of ByteHot's intelligent pattern recognition system, it enables the revolutionary capability to learn from hot-swap patterns and predict optimal intervention points.
